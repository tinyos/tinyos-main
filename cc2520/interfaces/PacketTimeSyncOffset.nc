 * Interface for one hop time synchronization. Allows to modify timesync
 * messages in the MAC layer with elapsed time of an event (ETA timesync
 * primitive). Interface also provides a command to determine offset within
 * a CC2420 packet, where the timesync ETA value is stored. word 'timestamping'
 * used in describing commands does not refer to metadata.timestamp value,
 *  rather it refers to the timesync ETA timestamp which is part of data
 *  payload and is transmitted over the air.
