  o Misc buf fixes.
  o PPPSniffer
  o fix I2CDR in msp430 USART code.
  o rf230 bug fixes

  o msp430 x2/usci: i2c uctxstt fix.
  o update Python Serial Stack

4449bba MDA300 support from Franco Di Persio.
d89fe5e Last commit for serial patch that resolves Google Code issue 152.
c40067f Patch serial stack.   (Python Serial Stack fix)
c70c461 rf212/rf230: Check that radio chip is not in sleep mode while reading the IRQ status register.
        There is a small chance that an interrupt fires just before the radio is put into sleep mode.
        Accessing the status register while the radio is sleeping will result in a wrong reading
        (all status bits read as high due to the pull-up resistor on the SPI data line).
0e4829e Added two default command handlers, otherwise MCPS_PURGE will not work in
        nonbeacon-enabled mode. This problem was discovered by David Rodenas.
26823b5 removed uisp references from Makefiles (but kept the definable PROGRAMMER)

b12646f rf212: update readme file for the new option
faec7cf rf212: rework the upload logic to make it faster and to make it work with slow SPI (based on rf230)
3862465 rf230: rework the upload logic to make it faster and to make it work with slow SPI
11833b0 Forgot to add the  UCTXSTT check in USCI B0
