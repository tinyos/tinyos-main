                       NOTE WELL
                       =========

	*NONE* of the items are being actively worked on.
        So, if you're interested in one of these features,
        it means you'll have to submit a patch... :-)


read list of interfaces with SIOCGIFCONF (AF_INET6 support in the kernel would
be nice) or from /proc

Quoting Peter Bieringer (peter@bieringer.de):

[ Peter wants that a debugging level greater than 0 doesn't stop radvd
from forking.]

support for few protocol constants defined in RFC 2461 Sec 10 is missing.

consider whether UnicastOnly flag should be detected by radvdump.

read the man pages one more time and make sure their are understandable
and English is correct

The following parts of RFC2461(bis) are not implemented:
 - section 6.2.1: Adv{Valid,Preferred}Lifetime that decrements in real time,
   that is, one that will result in a Lifetime of zero at the specified time in
   the future. (MUST)
 - section 6.2.5: when AdvSendAdvertisements changes to FALSE, we don't send 
   a final RA with zero Router Lifetime (we just send it when shutting down).
   (SHOULD)
 - section 6.2.8: if the link-local address of the router changes, it should
   multicast a few RAs from the old address with zero router lifetime, and a
   few from the new address. (SHOULD).

Consider whether to support RFC 4286 (Multicast Router Discovery).

Consider whether to support multiple IPv4 addresses with Base6to4Interface
(currently the code just uses the first one).

Consider whether to support a generalization of Base6to4Interface for
arbitrary IPv6 prefixes, to be used for automatic generation of downstream
prefixes.  Also consider whether this would need to support multiple IPv6
prefixes on the upstream interfaces.  See question 3 in README for more on
this.

Use getifaddrs() instead of ioctl SIOCGIFADDR and other friends.  The
problem with this is that e.g. RHL73's glibc didn't support getifaddrs(),
and before glibc 2.3.3 getifaddrs() didn't use netlink so it didn't work
well with IPv6.  So, some kind of compat library would be needed if this
would be used...

Consider whether radvd should work around missing/broken interfaces by
default, especially if a previously working interface gets disabled.

Implement Secure Neighbor Discovery (RFC 3971).
