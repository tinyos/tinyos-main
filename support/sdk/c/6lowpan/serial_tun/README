A daemon reading 6lowpan packets from the mote running the BaseStation
application via a USB interface, translating them to Ipv6 packets,
writing them to a tun interface and the other way round, i.e., reading
IPv6 packets from a tun interface, encapsulating them as 6lowpan
packets and sedning them to the mote.

To build the daemon you also need to build the libmote.a library in
$TOSROOT/support/sdk/c/.

Usage with a TelosB mote:
	sudo ./serial_tun /dev/ttyUSB0 115200

The Active Message address 12 and the corresponding IPv6 addresses are
are hardcoded in the source code.
