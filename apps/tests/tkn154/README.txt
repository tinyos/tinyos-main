README for tkn154 test applications
Author/Contact: tinyos-help@millennium.berkeley.edu

Description:

This folder contains test applications for "TKN15.4", a platform-independent
IEEE 802.15.4-2006 MAC implementation. Every test application resides in a
separate subdirectory which includes a README.txt describing what it does and
how it can be installed, respectively.

The TKN15.4 implementation can be found in tinyos-2.x/tos/lib/mac/tkn154.
Note: TEP3 recommends that interface names "should be mixed case, starting
upper case". To match the syntax used in the IEEE 802.15.4 standard the
interfaces provided by the MAC to the next higher layer deviate from this
convention (they are all caps, e.g. MLME_START).
