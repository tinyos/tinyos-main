Description:

A simple low-power-listening test app, which cycles through different
low-power-listening settings every ~32s, repeating every ~192s. 

This application currently runs on motes using the CC1000, CC2420,
RF230 and RFA1 radios.

This application blinks LED 0 every time it sends a message, and toggles
LED 1 every time it receives a message. If this application is
working correctly (see caveat about timing below), you should see 
both nodes toggling LED 1.

By default broadcast packets are sent. In order to test unicast transmission
with acknowledgements, uncomment the WITH_ACKS define in TestLplC.nc and
assign node IDs 1 and 2.

Its low-power-listening settings are as follows (repeating every 256s):

0-32s:     receive: fully on
           send: every second, to fully on listener

32-64s:    receive: fully on
	   send: every second, to low-power-listeners with 100ms interval

64-96s:    receive: low-power-listening with 250ms interval
	   send: every second, to low-power-listeners with 250ms interval

96-128s:   receive: low-power-listening with 250ms interval
	   send: every second, to fully on listener

128-160s:  receive: low-power-listening with 10ms interval
	   send: every second, to low-power-listeners with 10ms interval

160-192s:  receive: low-power-listening with 2000ms interval
	   send: every 7 seconds, to low-power-listeners with 2000ms interval

Whether two motes running TestLPL can receive each others messages depends
on their current send and receive low-power-listening settings. If you reset
two such motes at the same time, they will be able to receive each other's
messages in the following intervals: 0-96s and 128-192s.
