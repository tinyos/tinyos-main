README for TOSThreads TestCollection

Description:

TestCollection is a reimplementation of the Multihop Oscilloscope application
using TOSThreads. It periodically samples a universal software-based SineSensor
and broadcasts a message every few readings. These readings can be displayed by
the Java "Oscilloscope" application found in the the TestCollection/java
subdirectory. The sampling rate starts at 4Hz, but can be changed from the Java
application.

You can install TestCollection on a mote via the following command:
  make <platform> cthreads install

Valid platforms are currently: tmote, telosb, mica2, micaz and iris

At least two motes must be used by this application, with one of them installed
as a base station.  Base station motes can be created by installing them with
NODE_ID % 500 == 0.
  i.e. make <platform> cthreads install.0
       make <platform> cthreads install.500
       make <platform> cthreads install.1000

All other nodes can be installed with arbitrary NODE_IDs.
  make <platform> threads install.123

Successful running of this application is verified by all NON-base station motes
periodically flashing LED0 upon sending a message, and the base station mote,
flashing LED2 upon successful reception of a message.  Additionally, correct
operation should be verified by running the java tool described in the following
section.

Tools:

The Java application displays readings it receives from motes running the
MultihopOscilloscope demo via a serial forwarder. To run it, change to the
TestCollection/java subdirectory and type:

  make
  java net.tinyos.sf.SerialForwarder -comm serial@<serial port>:<baud_rate>
  # e.g., java net.tinyps.sf.SerialForwarder -comm serial@/dev/ttyUSB0:mica2
  # or java net.tinyps.sf.SerialForwarder -comm serial@COM2:57600
  ./run

NOTE::  The baud rate 57600 must be used telos based motes, as its configuration
has been changed to work with this baud rate when compiled for tosthreads. I.e.
DO NOT just substitute 'telosb' or 'tmote' for <baud_rate> above.  Explicitly
set it to 57600.

The controls at the bottom of the screen allow you to zoom in or out the X
axis, change the range of the Y axis, and clear all received data. You can
change the color used to display a mote by clicking on its color in the
mote table.

Notes:
  By default, the Makefile for TestCollection is setup to run CTP as the
  underlying collection protocol.  The makefile can be modified to work with
  MultihopLQI by changing the appropriate include directories.

Known bugs/limitations:
  Warnings are issued about fan out on the 'Snoop.receive' and 'Receive.receive'
  events.  These warnings are harmless and are the result of providing a C based
  API in which all events for receiving and snooping must be handled even if not
  used by a particular application.  The warnings occur because the underlying
  CTP or MultihopLQI stacks wire up to particular AM ids, which are also wired
  into the C API for handling message reception.
