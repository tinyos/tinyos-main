Description:

This application is derived from a similar application in the TinyThread 
implementation by William P. McCartney from Cleveland State University (2006)

This application stresses the operation of the thread based AM commands for
packet transmission and reception.  To run this application you will need to
burn it on one mote with NODE_ID 0, and a second mote with NODE_ID 1. 

You can install Bounce on a mote via the following command:
  make <platform> cthreads install.0
  make <platform> cthreads install.1
  
Valid platforms are currently: tmote, telosb, iris, mica2, micaz, and epic

Three different threads run that each contain an infinite loop that first sends
a message and then waits to receive a message before returning to the top of the
loop. After each message reception, one of the onboard LEDs is toggled to
indicate that it was received. Thread 0 blinks LED0, thread 1 blinks LED1, and
thread 2 blinks LED2. The three threads run independently, and three different
messages are bounced back and forth between the two motes in an unsynchronized
fashion.  In contrast to the more complicated Bounce application found in the
normal nesC threads version of this application, once a thread receives a
message it will immediately flip on its LED instead of waiting on a Barrier and
synchronizing the LEDs to come on only once messages have been received from all
threads.  In this way, messages are bounced back and forth between the two motes
in an asynchronous fashion, and LEDS are toggled immediately upon message
reception..  

Successful running of this application results in each LED bouncing back and
forth between each mote independent of one another.  This will continue in an
finite loop forever.
