Description:

BaseStation is a reimplementation of the standard BaseStation application using
the TOSThreads thread library.  It transparently forwards any AM messages it
receives from its radio interface to its serial interface and vice versa. Upon
successful reception of a packet, LED0 is toggled, and upon successful
forwarding, LED1 is toggled.  If there are any errors, LED2 is toggled.  

To run this application install it on a mote via the command:
  make <platform> cthreads install.45
  
Valid platforms are currently: tmote, telosb, iris, mica2, and micaz 

Installing with NODE_ID 45 (i.e. AM_ADDRESS 45) is just to verify that the
application forwards packets with an arbitrarily chosen id, which it should.

To test the correct operation of this application, you need two motes:  one with
this BaseStation application installed on it, and one with an application that
is sending messages installed, (let's use the RadioStress application from the
current directory).  

On one mote install the Base station via the command above, and on the other
install RadioStress via the command:
  make <platform> cthreads install.1
  
Don't forget the '.1' when you install, or RadioStress will be configured to
receive rather than send messages.  Messages are sent to AM_ADDRESS 0.

A successful test will result in the RadioStress mote constantly flickering all
of its leds very rapidly, and the BaseStation mote flickering its LED0 and LED1
leds rapidly.  Additionally, messages should be forwarded over the serial interface
as verified by running the following for the platform of interest:
  java net.tinyos.tools.Listen -comm serial@/dev/ttyUSBXXX:<baud_rate>
  
NOTE::  The baud rate 57600 must be used telos based motes, as its configuration
has been changed to work with this baud rate when compiled for tosthreads. I.e.
DO NOT just substitute 'telosb' or 'tmote' for <baud_rate> above.  Explicitly
set it to 57600.

Once this java application is running, you should see output of the sort
constantly being streamed to your terminal:
  00 00 00 00 01 00 00 14 
  00 00 00 00 01 00 00 16
