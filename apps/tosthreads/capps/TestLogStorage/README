Description:

TestLogStorage is a threaded implementation of an application that takes a dummy
sensor readings of a counter, logs it flash, and then sends it out over the
serial port at some later time. In the current implementation, each sensor reading is
taken once every 3000ms, and records containing a set of readings from each
iteration are batched out over the radio every 10000ms.  This application is
very similar to the SenseStoreAndForward application contained in this same
directory, except that it is written using a dummy sensor value instead of
sensors specific to the tmote onboard suite. In this way, the LogStorage
functionality can be tested in conjunction with the sending facility in a
platform independent way.

To run this application install it on a mote via the command:
  make <platform> cthreads install
  
Valid platforms are currently: tmote, telosb, iris, mica2, and micaz

Readings are taken from the dummy sensor and logged to flash as one record in an
infinite loop. Records are then read out of flash and and sent out over the
serial interface in separate infinite loop.  Before the application starts
running, the entire contents of the flash drive are erased.

A successful test will result in LED0 remaining solid for approximately 6s while
the flash is being erased.  After that LED0 will toggle with each successful
sensor readings logged to flash, at a rate of 3000ms.  Also, LED1 will begin
toggling in rapid succession once every 10000ms as records are successfully read
from flash and sent out over the serial port.  Once all of the records currently
recorded to flash since the last batch of sends have been sent out, LED2 Toggles
to indicate completion.  This process continues in an infinite loop forever.

Since the TestLogStorage mote writes its records out to the serial
port, you can test that the application is working properly by reading these
packets (e.g., through seriallisten) and checking that they have reasonable
values, counting up from 0. E.g.:

00 ff ff 00 00 06 00 25 00 00 00 9f 00 9f 
00 ff ff 00 00 06 00 25 00 00 00 a0 00 a0 
00 ff ff 00 00 06 00 25 00 00 00 a1 00 a1 
00 ff ff 00 00 06 00 25 00 00 00 a2 00 a2 
00 ff ff 00 00 06 00 25 00 00 00 a3 00 a3 

NOTE:  The baud rate 57600 must be used telos based motes, as its configuration
has been changed to work with this baud rate when compiled for tosthreads. I.e.
DO NOT just substitute 'telosb' or 'tmote' for <baud_rate> above.  Explicitly
set it to 57600.
