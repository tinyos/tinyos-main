README for TOSThreads ThreadStress

Description:

This application stresses the creation and destruction of dynamic threads by
spawning lots and lots of threads over and over again and letting them run to
completion.  Three different thread start functions are used, each toggling one
of LED0, LED1, and LED2 every 256 spawnings. The time at which each LED is
toggled is offset so that the three LEDS do not come on in unison.

You can install ThreadStress on a mote via the following command:
  make <platform> cthreads install
  
Valid platforms are currently: tmote, telosb, iris, mica2, and micaz 

Successful running of this application will result in all three leds flashing at
a rate determined by how long it takes to spawn a thread on a given platform. 
All three LEDs should flash at this rate in an infinite loop forever.  Given the
dynamics on the mote the rate may vary over time, but the important thing is
that all three LEDs continue to toggle at a reasonably visible rate.  

Tools:
  None.

Known bugs/limitations:
  None.
