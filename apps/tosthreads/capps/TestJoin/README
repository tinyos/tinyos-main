Description:

TestJoin is a simple application used to test the basic functionality of
the join() system call for waiting on a set of threads in a TOSThreads 
based application.

You can install TestJoin on a mote via the following command:
  make <platform> threads install
  
Valid platforms are currently: tmote, telosb, iris, mica2, micaz, and epic

Upon a successful burn, you should see all LEDs toggle in the following pattern,
repeating every 8 seconds:

0s: (110) LED0  ON, LED1  ON, LED2 OFF
1s: (000) LED0 OFF, LED1 OFF, LED2 OFF
2s: (010) LED0 OFF, LED1  ON, LED2 OFF
