Description:

This application is used to test the threaded version of the API for accessing
sensors on the basicsb sensor board.

You can install TestBasicsbSensors on a mote via the following comand:
  make <platform> threads install
  
Valid platforms are currently: mica2, and micaz 

This application simply takes sensor readings in an infinite loop from the 
Photo and Temperature sensors on the basicsb sensor board and forwards them
over the serial interface.  Upon successful transmission, LED0 is toggled.

A succssfull test will result in the TestBasicsbSensors mote constantly
flickering LED0. Additionally, messages containing the sensor readings should 
be forwarded over the serial interface as verified by running the following 
for the platform of interest:
  java net.tinyos.tools.Listen -comm serial@/dev/ttyUSBXXX:<baud_rate>

Once this java application is running, you should see output containing the
sensor readings being streamed to your terminal.

Tools:
  None.

Known bugs/limitations:
  None.
