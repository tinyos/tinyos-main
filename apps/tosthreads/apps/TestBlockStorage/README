Description:

This application is used to test the threaded version of the API for performing
block storage.

You can install TestBlockStorage on a mote via the following command:
  make <platform> threads install
  
Valid platforms are currently: tmote, telosb, mica2, and micaz 

This application first checks the size of the block storage volume, and
erases it. Then, it randomly writes records, followed by a verification
with read.

Successful running of this application results in LED0 being ON
throughout the duration of the erase, write, and read sequence. Finally,
if all tests pass, LED1 is turned ON. Otherwise, all three LEDs are
turned ON to indicate problems.

Tools:
  None.

Known bugs/limitations:
  None.
