Description:

This application is used to test the threaded version of the API for performing
block storage.

You can install TestBlockStorage on a mote via the following comand:
  make <platform> threads install
  
Valid platforms are currently: tmote, telosb, mica2, and micaz 

This application first erases a block storage volume, then randomly writes records to it,
followed by a verification with read.

Successful running of this application results in LED0 being ON throughout the duration
of the erase, write, and read sequence, followed by LED1 turning ON if all tests pass, and
all three LEDs turning on if there is a problem.

Tools:
  None.

Known bugs/limitations:
  None.
