A simple application which verifies the 6loWPAN stack is functioning
correctly.  A mote running this will respond to ICMP Echo requests
(0x80), and provide a UDP echo service on port 7 (a la rfc862).

It also provides a TCP echo service on port 7, and a simple HTTP
server on port 80.  The only resource supported is '/read/leds'.  This
functionality can be used to verify that the TCP stack is functional.

To build, use the 'blip' make target extra.  IE, 

$ make <platform> blip ...
