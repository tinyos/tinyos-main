<h1>Abstract</h1>
<p>This memo documents the TOSThreads thread library for TinyOS</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="introduction">
<h1>1. Introduction</h1>
<p>TOSThreads is an attempt to combine the ease of a threaded programming model
with the efficiency of a fully event-based OS. Unlike earlier threads packages
designed for TinyOS, TOSThreads supports fully-preemptive application level
threads, does not require explicit continuation management, and neither
violates TinyOS's concurrency model nor limits its concurrency.  Additionally,
adding support for TOSThreads requires minimal changes to the existing TinyOS
code base, and bringing up a new platform to support the use of TOSThreads
is a fairly easy process.</p>
<p>In TOSThreads, TinyOS runs inside a single high priority kernel thread, while all
application logic is implemented using user-level threads, which execute
whenever the TinyOS core becomes idle. This approach is a natural extension
to the existing TinyOS concurrency model, adding support for long-running
computations while preserving the timing-sensitive nature of TinyOS itself.</p>
<p>In this model, application threads access underlying TinyOS services using a
kernel API of blocking system calls. The kernel API defines the set of TinyOS
services provided to applications (e.g. time-sync <a class="citation-reference" href="#tep133" id="id1">[TEP133]</a>, collection <a class="citation-reference" href="#tep119" id="id2">[TEP119]</a>,
and dissemination <a class="citation-reference" href="#tep118" id="id3">[TEP118]</a>). Each system call in the API is comprised
of a thin blocking wrapper built on top of one of these services.  TOSThreads
allows systems developers to re-define the kernel API by appropriately
selecting (or implementing their own) custom set of blocking system call wrappers.</p>
<p>The following section describes the details of how TOSThreads interacts with
TinyOS to provide each of the features described above.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="basic-architecture">
<h1>2. Basic Architecture</h1>
<p>The existing TinyOS concurrency model has two execution contexts: synchronous
(tasks) and asynchronous (interrupts). These two contexts follow a strict
priority scheme: asynchronous code can preempt synchronous code but not
vice-versa. TOSThreads extends this concurrency model to provide a third execution
context in the form of user-level application threads. Application threads run
at the lowest priority, with the ability to only preempt one another.  They are
preemptable at any time by either synchronous code or asynchronous code, and
synchronize amongst each other using standard synchronization primitives
such as mutexes, semaphores, barriers, condition variables, and blocking
reference counters (a custom mechanism we have developed ourselves).  Take a look
in <tt class="docutils literal">tos/lib/tosthreads/interfaces</tt> to see the interfaces providing these
primitives.</p>
<p>The basic TOSThreads architecture, consists of five key elements: the TinyOS
task scheduler, a single kernel-level TinyOS thread, a thread scheduler, a
set of user-level application threads, and a set of system call APIs and their
corresponding implementations. Any number of application threads can
concurrently exist (barring memory constraints), while a single kernel thread
runs the TinyOS task scheduler. The thread scheduler manages concurrency
between application threads, while a set of system calls provides them
access to the TinyOS kernel.</p>
<p>In order to preserve the timing-sensitive operation of TinyOS, the kernel
thread has higher priority than application threads. This <em>TinyOS thread</em>
therefore always takes precedence over application threads as long as the TinyOS
task queue is non-empty. Once the TinyOS task queue empties, control passes to
the thread scheduler and application threads can run. The processer goes to
sleep only when either all application threads have run to completion, or when
all threads are waiting on synchronization primitives or blocked on I/O
operations.</p>
<p>There are two ways in which posted events can cause the TinyOS thread to wake
up. First, an application thread can issue a blocking system call into the
TinyOS kernel. This call internally posts a task, implicitly waking up the
TinyOS thread to process it. Second, an interrupt handler can post a task for
deferred computation. Since interrupt handlers have higher priority than the
TinyOS thread, the TinyOS thread will not wake up to process the task until
after the interrupt handler has completed. Because interrupts can arrive at
anytime, it is important to note that waking up the TinyOS thread may require
a context switch with an interrupted application thread. Control eventually
returns to the application thread after the TinyOS thread has emptied the
task queue.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="modifications-to-the-standard-tinyos-code-base">
<h1>3. Modifications to the Standard TinyOS Code Base</h1>
<p>Only two changes to the existing TinyOS code base are required to support
TOSThreads: a modification to the boot sequence and the addition of a post-amble
for every interrupt handler.  Changes to the boot sequence only need to be made
once and are independent of any platforms supported by TinyOS. Changes to the
interrupt handlers MUST be handled on a microcontroller to microntroller basis.
Additionally, a custom <tt class="docutils literal">chip_thread.h</tt> file MUST be created for each
microcontroller and place in its top level directory, e.g. <tt class="docutils literal">tos/chips/msp430</tt></p>
<div class="section" id="changes-to-the-boot-sequence">
<h2>3.1 Changes to the Boot Sequence</h2>
<p>Instead of directly running the TinyOS boot sequence inside of main() as
done previously, main() now calls out to a Boot.booted() event
associated with booting up the thread scheduler.:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
event void ThreadSchedulerBoot.booted() {
  //Thread sceduler specific init stuff
  ...
  ...

  //Encapsulate TinyOS inside a thread
  tos_thread = call ThreadInfo.get[TOSTHREAD_TOS_THREAD_ID]();
  tos_thread-&gt;id = TOSTHREAD_TOS_THREAD_ID;

  //Set the TinyOS thread as the current thread and activate it
  current_thread = tos_thread;
  current_thread-&gt;state = TOSTHREAD_STATE_ACTIVE;

  //Signal the boot sequence
  signal TinyOSBoot.booted();
}
</pre>
<p>This change is made in order to encapsulate TinyOS inside the single
kernel-level thread and set it as the initial thread that starts running.
Once this is done, the normal TinyOS boot sequence is ran by signaling the
TinyOSBoot.booted() event.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the existing TinyOS boot sequence, we enter an infinite
loop that continuously checks the TinyOS task scheduler to see if it
has any tasks to run.  If it does, it runs the next task in its queue.
If it does not, it puts the microcontroller into its lowest possible power
state and goes to sleep <a class="citation-reference" href="#tep112" id="id4">[TEP112]</a>.:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
command void Scheduler.taskLoop() {
  for (;;) {
    uint8_t nextTask;

    atomic {
      while ((nextTask = popTask()) == NO_TASK)
        call McuSleep.sleep();
    }
    signal TaskBasic.runTask[nextTask]();
  }
}
</pre>
<p>By adding threads as a lowest priority execution context, we need to change
these semantics slightly.  Instead of going directly to sleep, we want to
allow the thread scheduler to take control of the microcontroller and start
scheduling any threads it has to run.  Only once all application threads
have run to completion, or when all threads are waiting on synchronization
primitives or blocked on I/O operations is the microcontroller put to sleep.</p>
<p>We achieve such functionality by replacing the call to McuSleep.sleep() shown
above, by a call that signals the thread scheduler to suspend the currently
running thread (the TinyOS kernel thread).:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
command void TaskScheduler.taskLoop() {
  for (;;) {
    uint8_t nextTask;

    atomic {
      while((nextTask = popTask()) == NO_TASK)
        call ThreadScheduler.suspendCurrentThread();
    }
    signal TaskBasic.runTask[nextTask]();
  }
}
</pre>
<p>Once the TinyOS thread has been suspended, the thread scheduler is free to
begin scheduling application level threads however it sees fit.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="interrupt-handler-post-ambles">
<h2>3.2 Interrupt Handler Post-Ambles</h2>
<p>With the changes described above, the only other <em>non-self-contained</em>
TinyOS code necessary to support TOSThreads is the addition of a post-amble
at the bottom of every interrupt handler.  Since the number and type
of interrupt handlers, as well as the semantics required for implementing
them, differ from platform to platform, the way in which this post-amble is
is added is highly dependent on the microcontroller in use.  The post-amble
itself, however, is completely platform-independent, and is provided via a
<tt class="docutils literal">postAmble()</tt> command included in the <tt class="docutils literal">PlatformInterrupt</tt> interface.:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
command void PlatformInterrupt.postAmble() {
  atomic {
  if(call ThreadScheduler.wakeupThread(TOSTHREAD_TOS_THREAD_ID) == SUCCESS)
    if(call ThreadScheduler.currentThreadId() != TOSTHREAD_TOS_THREAD_ID)
      call ThreadScheduler.interruptCurrentThread();
  }
}
</pre>
<p>As described in the following section, the call to <tt class="docutils literal">wakeupThread()</tt> returns
SUCCESS iff the TinyOS task queue has any tasks to process (i.e. the interrupt
handler posted some tasks), otherwise it returns FAIL.  Upon FAIL, we simply
return from this function, and continue execution from the point at which the
currently running thread was interrupted.  Upon SUCCESS, we preempt the current
thread, immediately scheduling the TinyOS thread for execution.  The check to
make sure that the current thread isn't already the TinyOS thread is simply an
optimization used to bypass ''rescheduling'' the already running thread.</p>
<p>This <tt class="docutils literal">postAmble()</tt> command MUST be called at the bottom of EVERY interrupt
handler provided by a platform.  This interface is provided by the
<tt class="docutils literal">PlatformInterruptC</tt> component, and MUST be wired into every component which
implements an interrupt handler.  Calls to <tt class="docutils literal">postAmble()</tt> MUST then be made
just before any return points in the given interrupt handler.</p>
<div class="note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">Attempts were made to try and simplify / automate the inclusion of the
post amble through the use of MACROS and other means. It was determined in
the end, however, that this was the simplest and most readable way
to keep the implementation of the post-amble platform independent, while
allowing it to be included on a platform by platform basis for differing
interrrupt handler implementations.</p>
</div>
<p>As an example, consider the case of the interrupt handlers for the
TIMERA0_VECTOR and ADC_VECTOR on the msp430 microcontroller:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
TOSH_SIGNAL(TIMERA0_VECTOR) {
  //Body of interrupt handler
  ...
  ...

  call PlatformInterrupt.postAmble();
}

TOSH_SIGNAL(ADC_VECTOR) {
  //Body of interrupt handler
  ...
  ...

  call PlatformInterrupt.postAmble();
}
</pre>
<p>The component in which each of these handlers is defined MUST wire in
the <tt class="docutils literal">PlatformInterrupt</tt> interface provided by <tt class="docutils literal">PlatformInterruptC</tt>
and call <tt class="docutils literal">postAmble()</tt> at the bottom of their interrupt handlers.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-chip-thread-h-file">
<h2>3.3 The <tt class="docutils literal">chip_thread.h</tt> file</h2>
<p>A <tt class="docutils literal">chip_thread.h</tt> MUST be created in the chips directory for each
microcontroller supporting the TOSThreads library.  This file MUST contain
definitions of the following:</p>
<p>(1) A structure containing space for saving any microcontroller specific
registers needed to save state when doing a context switch.:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
typedef struct thread_regs {
  ...
} thread_regs_t;
</pre>
<p>(2) A typedef of a <tt class="docutils literal">stack_ptr_t</tt> type.  For example, the msp430 microconroller
has 16 bit memory addresses, so <tt class="docutils literal">stack_prt_t</tt> is typedefed as follows.:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
typedef uint16_t* stack_ptr_t;
</pre>
<p>(3) Definitions of the following MACROS for use by the TOSThreads thread
scheduler.:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
PREPARE_THREAD(thread, start_function)
SWITCH_CONTEXTS(current_thread, next_thread)
RESTORE_TCB(next_thread)
STACK_TOP(stack, size)
</pre>
<p>As explained in Section 4.2, state manipulated by these MACROS is
carried around by a thread as part of its <em>Thread Control Block (TCB)</em>, defined
as type 'thread_t'.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">PREPARE_THREAD()</tt> takes two parameters: 'thread' and 'start_function'.  The
'thread' parameter MUST be of type <tt class="docutils literal">thread_t</tt>, and 'start_function' MUST be of
type <tt class="docutils literal">void <span class="pre">(*start_function)(void)</span></tt>.  The purpose of <tt class="docutils literal">PREPARE_THREAD()</tt> is
to get a thread ready for the first time it starts to execute.  Primarily, it is
used to set the top of the stack associated with 'thread' to its
'start_function'.  When it comes time for the thread to begin executing, the
address pointed to by 'start_function' will be popped off and it will start executing.</p>
<p>As an example, consider the definition of <tt class="docutils literal">PREPARE_THREAD()</tt> for the msp430
microcontroller:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
#define PREPARE_THREAD(t, thread_ptr)         \
  *((t)-&gt;stack_ptr) = (uint16_t)(&amp;(thread_ptr));      \
  SAVE_STATUS(t)
</pre>
<p>In this case, the status register is also saved with its initial setup, but this
may not be necessary for all microcontrollers.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">SWITCH_CONTEXTS()</tt> takes two parameters: current_thread and next_thread. Both
parameters MUST be of type 'thread_t'.The purpose of <tt class="docutils literal">SWITCH_CONTEXTS()</tt> is to
store the state of the thread associated with the 'current_thread', and swap it
out with the state of the 'next_thread'.  The amount and type of state saved,
and how it is actually swapped out varies from microcontroller to microcontroller.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">RESTORE_TCB()</tt> takes just one parameter: next_thread.  This parameter MUST be
of type 'thread_t'. <tt class="docutils literal">RESTORE_TCB()</tt> is similar to <tt class="docutils literal">SWITCH_CONTEXTS()</tt> except
that no state is stored about the current thread before swapping in the state
associated with 'next_thread'.  This MACRO is primarily called at the time a
thread is either killed or has run to completion.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">STACK_TOP()</tt> takes two parameters: 'stack' and 'size'.  The 'stack' parameter
MUST be of type <tt class="docutils literal">stack_ptr_t</tt> and 'size' MUST be an integer type (i.e.
uint8_t, uint16_t, etc).  As explained in Section 4.2, whenever a thread is
created, it is allocated its own stack space with a given size.  As a thread
executes, local variables, register values, and the return address of procedure
calls are pushed onto this stack. Depending on the microcontroller in use, the
<em>top</em> of a thread's stack might exist at either the highest address (stack grows
down) or lowest address (stack grows up) of the data structure allocated to the
stack.  The purpose of <tt class="docutils literal">STACK_TOP()</tt> is to return a pointer of type
<tt class="docutils literal">uint8_t*</tt> to the location of the <em>top</em> of the stack.  <tt class="docutils literal">STACK_TOP()</tt> is only
called once at the time a thread is first initialized.</p>
<p>There are only two choices for the definition of this MACRO, and both are shown
below.:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
//Stack grows down (i.e. need to return pointer to bottom of structure (highest address))
#define STACK_TOP(stack, size)    \
  (&amp;(((uint8_t*)stack)[size - sizeof(stack_ptr_t)]))
</pre>
<pre class="literal-block">
//Stack grows up (i.e. need to return pointer to top of structure (lowest address))
#define STACK_TOP(stack, size)    \
  (&amp;(((uint8_t*)stack)[0]))
</pre>
<p>As an example, consider the msp430 and atmega128 microcontrollers. On both of
these microcontrollers, a thread's stack grows down as it executes, so
<tt class="docutils literal">STACK_TOP()</tt> is defined using the first macro.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-tosthreads-library-implementation">
<h1>4. The TOSThreads Library Implementation</h1>
<p>This section describes the implementation of TOSThreads, including the
internals of the thread scheduler, the thread and system call
data structures, and their corresponding interfaces.</p>
<div class="section" id="the-thread-scheduler">
<h2>4.1 The Thread Scheduler</h2>
<p>The thread scheduler is the first component to take control of the
microcontroller during the boot process. As mentioned previously, its job is to
encapsulate TinyOS inside a thread and trigger the normal TinyOS boot sequence.
Once TinyOS boots and processes all of its initial tasks, control returns to the
thread scheduler which begins scheduling application threads. The scheduler
keeps threads ready for processing on a ready queue, while threads blocked on
I/O requests or waiting on a lock are kept on different queues.</p>
<p>The default TOSThreads scheduler implements a fully preemptive round-robin
scheduling policy with a time slice of 5 msec. We chose this value to achieve
low latency across multiple application-level computing tasks. While application
threads currently run with the same priority, one can easily modify the
scheduler to support other policies.</p>
<p>As explained in the following section, TOSThreads exposes a relatively
standard API for creating and manipulating threads: <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">create(),</span>
<span class="pre">destroy(),</span> pause() and resume()</tt>. These functions form part of the system
call API, and can be invoked by any application program.</p>
<p>Internally, TOSThreads library components use the following <tt class="docutils literal">ThreadScheduler</tt>
interface to interact with a thread.:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
interface ThreadScheduler {
  async command uint8_t currentThreadId();
  async command thread_t* currentThreadInfo();
  async command thread_t* threadInfo(thread_id_t id);

  command error_t initThread(thread_id_t id);
  command error_t startThread(thread_id_t id);
  command error_t stopThread(thread_id_t id);

  async command error_t interruptCurrentThread();

  async command error_t suspendCurrentThread();
  async command error_t wakeupThread(thread_id_t id);
}
</pre>
<p>The thread scheduler itself does not exist in any particular execution context
(i.e., it is not a thread and does not have its own stack). Instead, any
TOSThreads library component that invokes one of the above commands executes in
the context of the calling thread. Due to the sensitive nature of these
commands, ONLY the interrupt handler post-ambles and blocking system call API
wrappers invoke them directly.</p>
<p>The first three commands are used to get information associated with an instance
of a thread.  Calling <tt class="docutils literal">currentThreadId()</tt> returns a unique identifier
associated with the currently running thread.  Calling <tt class="docutils literal">currentThreadInfo()</tt>
or <tt class="docutils literal">threadInfo()</tt> on a particular thread returns a pointer to the complete
<em>Thread Control Block (TCB)</em> associated with a thread.  Details about the TCB
structure returned by these comamnds are given in section 4.2.</p>
<p>The rest of the commands in this interface are used to manipulate the state of a
thread, putting it into one of 4 distinct states and starting / stopping its
execution as necessary.  At any given time, a thread may exist in one of the
following states (INACTIVE, ACTIVE, READY, SUSPENDED).</p>
<p>Threads are initialized into the INACTIVE state via a call to <tt class="docutils literal">initThread()</tt>.
This command MUST only be called once at the time a thread is first created.  A
call to <tt class="docutils literal">initThread()</tt> MUST be followed by a call to <tt class="docutils literal">startThread()</tt> at some
point later in order to start the actual execution of the thread.  Calls to
<tt class="docutils literal">initThread()</tt> always return SUCCESS;</p>
<p>Calls to <tt class="docutils literal">startThread()</tt> return either SUCCESS or FAIL, depending on the state
a thread is in when it is called.  If a thread is in the INACTIVE state, calling
this command puts a thread into the READY state and places it on a ready queue.
Threads are scheduled for execution by puling threads off this ready queue in
FCFS order.  If a thread is in any state other than INACTIVE, FAIL is returned,
and no other side effects occur.</p>
<p>Calls to <tt class="docutils literal">stopThread()</tt> only return SUCCESS if called on a thread that is in
the READY state (and thereby implicitly on the ready queue) and currently holds
no mutexes.  The <tt class="docutils literal">mutex_count</tt> field in a thread's TCB is used to determine if
any mutexes are currently held.  If both of these conditions are met, a thread
is removed from the READY queue and its state is set to INACTIVE.  If either of
these conditions are not met, calling <tt class="docutils literal">stopThread()</tt> returns FAIL and no other
side effects occur.</p>
<p>Calls to <tt class="docutils literal">interruptCurrentThread()</tt> are made in order to preempt a currently
running thread. Calling <tt class="docutils literal">interruptCurrentThread()</tt> returns SUCCESS if the
currently running thread is in the ACTIVE state (SHOULD always be true),
otherwise it returns FAIL.  Upon FAIL no side effects occur.  Upon SUCCESS, the
currently running thread is put into the READY state and placed on the thread
scheduler's ready queue.  Threads in the READY state are not blocked, and will
be scheduled for execution again the next time their turn comes up.  The
<tt class="docutils literal">interruptCurrentThread()</tt> function is currently only called in two places.
At the bottom of the interrupt <tt class="docutils literal">postAmble()</tt> (as shown before), and in the
code implementing the round-robin preemption scheme.</p>
<p>Calls to <tt class="docutils literal">suspendCurrentThread()</tt> return SUCCESS if the currently running
thread is in the ACTIVE state (SHOULD always be true), otherwise they return
FAIL.  Upon SUCCESS, the currently running thread is put into the SUSPEND state
and its execution is stopped.  A thread in the SUSPEND state will not be
scheduled for execution again until a call to <tt class="docutils literal">wakeupThread()</tt> is made at some
later point in time. Calls to <tt class="docutils literal">suspendCurrentThread()</tt> SHOULD only be made
from within the body of blocking system call API wrappers or synchronization
primitives.</p>
<p>Calls to <tt class="docutils literal">wakeupThread()</tt> take one parameter: 'thread_id'. <tt class="docutils literal">wakeupThread()</tt>
returns SUCCESS if the thread associated with 'thread_id' is successfully woken up
and returns FAIL otherwise.  For all threads other than the TinyOS thread, SUCCESS
will only be returned if the thread being woken up is in the SUSPEND state.  For the
TinyOS thread, it must be both in the SUSPEND state and have tasks waiting on it
task queue.  Upon SUCCESS, a thread is put in the READY state and placed on the ready
queue.  Upon FAIL, no side effects occur.</p>
<div class="note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">Most times calls to <cite>suspendCurrentThread()`</cite> are paired with placing the
suspended thread on a queue.  Calls to <tt class="docutils literal">wakeupThread()</tt> are then paired with
removing a thread from that queue.  The queue used is matianed externally by
the component issuing the suspend and wakeup.  For example, every mutex
variable has its own queue associated with it. Everytime a thread calls the
<tt class="docutils literal">lock()</tt> function associated with a mutex, it is placed onto the queue
associated with that mutex if someone already holds the lock.  When the owner
of the lock eventually calls <tt class="docutils literal">unlock()</tt> this queue is then checked and
requesters are removed from the queue in FCFS order.</p>

<div class="section" id="threads">
<h2>4.2 Threads</h2>
<p>Section 4 discusses the API provided to an application that allows it to create
and destroy theads, as well as invoke blocking system calls.  This section
details the internals of the thread implementation itself, focusing on the data
structure used to actually represent threads.</p>
<p>Regardless of the API used to create a thread (either <em>statically</em> or
<em>dynamically</em> as discussed in the following section), TOSThreads allocates a
Thread Control Block (TCB) and stack memory for each thread at the time it is
created.  Each thread has a fixed stack size that does not grow over time.  The
code snippet below shows the structure of a TOSThreads TCB.:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
struct thread {
  thread_id_t thread_id;
  init_block_t* init_block;
  struct thread* next_thread;

  //thread_state
  uint8_t state;
  uint8_t mutex_count;
  thread_regs_t regs;

  //start_function
  void (*start_ptr)(void*);
  void* start_arg_ptr;

  stack_ptr_t stack_ptr;
  syscall_t* syscall;
};
</pre>
<p><strong>thread_id</strong>: This field stores a thread's unique identifier.
It is used primarily by system call implementations and synchronization
primitives to identify the thread that should be blocked or woken up.</p>
<p><strong>init_block</strong>: Applications implemented using the TOSThreds library have the
ability to be dynamically loaded onto a mote at runtime.  It is beyond the scope
of this TEP to go into the details of this process, but applications use this
field whenever they are dynamically loaded onto a mote. Whenever the system
dynamically loads a TOSThreads application, the threads it creates must all
receive the state associated with its global variables. An initialization block
structure stores these global variables and 'init_block' points to this structure.</p>
<p><strong>next_thread</strong>: TOSThreads uses thread queues to keep track of threads waiting
to run. These queues are implemented as linked lists of threads connected
through their next_thread' pointers. By design, a single pointer suffices:
threads are <em>always</em> added to a queue just before they are interrupted and
are removed form a queue just before they wake up. This approach conserves
memory.</p>
<p><strong>thread_state</strong> This set of fields store information about the thread's current
state. It contains a count of the number of mutexes the thread currently holds;
a state variable indicating the state the thread is in (INACTIVE, READY,
SUSPENDED, or ACTIVE); and a set of variables that store a processor's register
state whenever a context switch occurs.</p>
<p><strong>stack_pointer</strong> This field points to the top of a thread's stack. Whenever a
context switch is about to occur, the thread scheduler calls a
<tt class="docutils literal">switch_threads()</tt> function, pushing the return address onto the current
thread's stack. This function stores the current thread's register state,
replaces the processor's stack pointer with that of a new thread, and finally
restores the register state of the new thread. Once this function returns, the
new thread resumes its execution from the point it was interrupted.</p>
<p><strong>start_function</strong> This field points to a thread's start function along with a
pointer to a single argument. The application developer must ensure that the
structure the argument points to is not deallocated before the thread's start
function executes. These semantics are similar to those that Unix <tt class="docutils literal">pthreads</tt>
define.</p>
<p><strong>system_call_block</strong> This field contains a pointer to a structure used when
making system calls into a TOSThreads kernel. This structure is readable by both a
system call wrapper implementation and the TinyOS kernel thread. The section
that follows explains how this structure is used.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="blocking-system-calls">
<h2>4.3 Blocking System Calls</h2>
<p>TOSThreads implements blocking system calls by wrapping existing TinyOS services
inside blocking APIs. These wrappers are responsible for maintaining state
across the non-blocking <em>split-phase</em> operations associated with the
underlying TinyOS services. They also transfer control to the TinyOS thread
whenever a user thread invokes a system call.  All wrappers are written in nesC
with an additional layer of C code layered on top of them.  We refer to the
TOSThreads <em>standard</em> C API as the API providing system calls to standard
TinyOS services such as sending packets, sampling sensors, and writing to flash.
Alternative API's (potentially also written in C) can be implemented as well
(e.g. the Tenet API).</p>
<p>A user thread initiates a system call by calling a function in one of the
blocking API wrappers. This function creates a local instance of a
<em>system call block (SCB)</em> structure which contains: a unique
'syscall_id' associated with the system call; a pointer to the
'thread' invoking the call; a pointer to the function that TinyOS should
call once it assumes control, and the set of parameters this function should
receive. The SCB is used to exchange data with the TinyOS thread.:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
struct syscall {
  syscall_id_t syscall_id;
  thread_t* thread;
  void (*syscall_ptr)(struct syscall*);
  void* params;
};
</pre>
<p>All variables associated with a system call (i.e., the pointer to the SCB and
the parameters passed to the system call itself) can all be allocated on the
local stack of the calling thread at the time of the system call. This is
possible because once the calling thread invokes a system call, it will not
return from the function which instantiates these variables until after the
blocking system call completes. These variables remain on the local thread's
stack throughout the duration of the system call and can therefore be accessed
as necessary.</p>
<p>As discussed in Section 2, making a system call implicitly posts a TinyOS task,
causing the TinyOS thread to immediately wake up and the calling thread to
block. In this way, there can only be <em>one</em> outstanding system call at any given
time. Thus, only a <em>single</em> TinyOS task is necessary to perform an
applications' system calls. The body of this task simply invokes the function
the 'system_call_block' points to.</p>
<p>The important interfaces and components that implement the functionality
described in this section can be found in <tt class="docutils literal">tos/lib/tosthreads/system</tt> and
<tt class="docutils literal">tos/lib/tosthreads/interfaces</tt>.  The important ones to look at are the
<tt class="docutils literal">SystemCall</tt> interface, and the <tt class="docutils literal">SystemCallC</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">SystemCallP</tt>
components.  Example system call wrappers themselves include
<tt class="docutils literal">BlockingStdControlC</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">BlockingAMSenderC</tt>, etc.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="programming-applications">
<h1>5. Programming Applications</h1>
<p>Application written using TOSThreads can be programmed in either nesC or
standard C.  In nesC, threads can either be created <em>statically</em> or
<em>dynamically</em> as a TOSThreads application executes.  The primary difference
between the two is that statically allocated threads have their TCB allocated
for them at compile time while dynamic threads have them allocated at run time.</p>
<div class="section" id="static-threads">
<h2>5.1 Static Threads</h2>
<p>Static threads are created by wiring in an instance of a ThreadC component as shown
below.  As a parameter to ThreadC, we pass in the desired stack size for the thread.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
configuration ExampleAppC {
}
implementation {
  components MainC, ExampleC;
  components new ThreadC(STACK_SIZE);

  MainC.Boot &lt;- ExampleC;
  ExampleC.Thread -&gt; ThreadC;
}
</pre>
<p>The ThreadC component provides a <tt class="docutils literal">Thread</tt> interface for creating and
manipulating static threads from within a nesC module.:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
 interface Thread {
   command error_t start(void* arg);
   command error_t stop();
   command error_t pause();
   command error_t resume();
   command error_t sleep(uint32_t milli);
   event void run(void* arg);
}
</pre>
<p>Calling <tt class="docutils literal">start()</tt> on a thread signals to the TOSThreads thread scheduler that
that thread should begin executing.  <tt class="docutils literal">start()</tt> takes as an argument a pointer
to a data structure to pass to a thread once it starts executing.  Calls to
<tt class="docutils literal">start()</tt> return either SUCCESS or FAIL.  Upon SUCCESS, the thread is
scheduled for execution, and at some point later the <tt class="docutils literal">run()</tt> event is
signaled.  The body of the run event implements the logic of the thread.</p>
<p>Calling <tt class="docutils literal">stop()</tt> on a thread signals to the TOSThreads thread scheduler that
that thread should stop executing.  Once a thread is stopped it cannot be
restarted. Calls to <tt class="docutils literal">stop()</tt> return SUCESS if a thread was successfully
stopped, and FAIL otherwise. <tt class="docutils literal">stop()</tt> MUST NOT be called from within the
thread being stopped; it MUST be called from either the TinyOS thread or another
application thread.</p>
<p>Calling <tt class="docutils literal">pause()</tt> on a thread signals to the TOSThreads thread scheduler that
that thread should be paused.  Pausing a thread is different than stopping it in
that a <em>paused</em> thread can be restarted again later by calling <tt class="docutils literal">resume()</tt> on
it.  Underneath, the <tt class="docutils literal">pause()</tt> command is implemented by calling the thread
scheduler's <tt class="docutils literal">suspendCurrentThread()</tt> command.  Calls to <tt class="docutils literal">pause()</tt> return
SUCCESS if a thread is paused, and FAIL otherwise.  Essentially, <tt class="docutils literal">pause()</tt> is
used to perform an explicit suspension of the currently running thread.
<tt class="docutils literal">pause()</tt> MUST ONLY be called from within the thread itself that is being
paused.  Note that these are exactly the opposite semantics than those used for
<tt class="docutils literal">stop()</tt>.</p>
<p>Calling <tt class="docutils literal">resume()</tt> wakes up a thread previously suspended via the <tt class="docutils literal">pause()</tt>
command. SUCCESS is returned if the thread was successfully resumed, FAIL
otherwise.</p>
<p>Calling <tt class="docutils literal">sleep()</tt> puts a thread to sleep for the interval specified in its
single 'milli' parameter. <tt class="docutils literal">sleep()</tt> MUST ONLY be called from within the thread
itself that is being put to sleep.  SUCCESS is returned if the thread was
successfully put to sleep, FAIL otherwise.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="dynamic-threads">
<h2>5.2 Dynamic Threads</h2>
<p>Dynamic threads are created by wiring in an instance of a DynamicThreadC
component as shown below.:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
configuration ExampleAppC {
}
implementation {
  components MainC, ExampleC;
  components DynamicThreadC;

  MainC.Boot &lt;- ExampleC;
  BlinkC.DynamicThread -&gt; DynamicThreadC;
}
</pre>
<p>The nesC interface for creating and manipulating dynamic threads is.:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
interface DynamicThread {
  command error_t create(tosthread_t* t, void (*start_routine)(void*),
                         void* arg, uint16_t stack_size);
  command error_t destroy(tosthread_t* t);
  command error_t pause(tosthread_t* t);
  command error_t resume(tosthread_t* t);
}
</pre>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">create()</tt> is used to create a new dynamic thread.  It takes 4 parameters:
't', 'start_routine', 'arg', and 'stack_size'.  't' is pointer to a unique
handler associated with the thread being created. 'start_routine' is the start
function associated with the thread.  'arg' is a pointer to a structure passed
to the start function once the thread has begun executing.  'stack_size' is the
size of the stack to be dynamicaly allocated for the thread.  Calls to
<tt class="docutils literal">create()</tt> return either SUCCESS, FAIL, or EALREADY.  SUCCESS indiactes that
the thread has been successfully created, FAIL means it could not be created,
and EALREADY indicates that the handler assocaited with the 't' parameter is
associated with an already running thread.  Upon SUCCESS, a dynamic thread's TCB
and stack memory are dynamically allocated, and the thread is scheduled for
execution.  Its 'start_routine' whill be called once it begins running.  UPON
FAIL or EALREADY, no side effects occur.</p>
<p>''destroy()`` is similar to <tt class="docutils literal">stop()</tt> from a static thread's <tt class="docutils literal">Thread</tt>
interface.  It follows all the same semantics as this command, except that it
deallocates the TCB and stack memory associated with a thread before returning.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">pause()</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">resume()</tt> are identical to their counterparts in the
<tt class="docutils literal">Thread</tt> interface.</p>
<p>The API allowing TOSThreads applications to be written in standard C includes a
set of functions that simply wrap the commands provided by the
<tt class="docutils literal">DynamicThread</tt> interface.  The following section shows an example of how
these functions are used.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-full-tosthreads-api">
<h2>5.3 The Full TOSThreads API</h2>
<p>As mentioned previously, TinyOS services are presented to TOSThreads applications
by wrapping their functionality inside blocking system calls.  The number and type
of standard services provided is constantly growing so it doesn't make sense to
try and list them all out.  Browse through <tt class="docutils literal">tos/lib/tosthreads/system/</tt> and
<tt class="docutils literal">tos/lib/tosthreads/lib</tt> to see what services are currently available.
Also, take a look at the various applications found in <tt class="docutils literal">apps/tosthreads</tt> to see
how these services are used.  There are applications written in nesC using both
static and dynamic threads, as well as applications written in standard C.</p>
