<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">This document gives a brief overview of TinyOS 2.0, highlighting how
and where it departs from 1.1 and 1.0. Further detail on these changes
is detailed in TEP (TinyOS Enhancement Proposal) documents.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1><a id="introduction" name="introduction">1. Introduction</a></h1>
<p>TinyOS 2.0 is a clean slate redesign and re-implementation of TinyOS.
Its development was motivated by our belief that many aspects of 1.x
strain to meet requirements and uses that were not foreseen
when it was designed and implemented. The structure and interfaces 1.x
defines have several fundamental limitations. While these limitations
can be worked around, this practice has led to tightly coupled
components, hard to find interactions, and a very steep learning curve
for a newcomer to sensor network programming.</p>
<p>TinyOS 2.0 is not backwards compatible with 1.x: code written for the
latter will not compile for the former. However, one important aspect
of 2.0's design is to minimize the difficulty of upgrading
code. Therefore, while porting a 1.x application to 2.0 will require
some work, it should not be very much.</p>
<p>This document provides a high-level overview of 2.0 and describes some
of the ways in which it departs from 1.x. It covers the basic TinyOS
abstractions, such as hardware abstractions, communication, timers,
the scheduler, booting and initialization. Further detail on each of
these can be found in TEPs (TinyOS Enhancement Proposals), which
document and describe these abstractions.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1><a id="platforms-hardware-abstraction" name="platforms-hardware-abstraction">2. Platforms/Hardware Abstraction</a></h1>
<p>Platforms exist in the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">tos/platforms</span></tt> subdirectory. In TinyOS 2.0, a
<em>platform</em> is a collection of <em>chips</em> and some glue code that connects
them together. For example, the mica2 platform is the CC1000 radio
chip and the ATmega128 microcontroller, while the micaZ platform is
the CC2420 radio and the ATmega128 microcontroller, and the Teloi
platforms are the CC2420 radio and the MSP430 microcontroller. Chip
code exists in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">tos/chips</span></tt>. A platform directory generally has a
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.platform</span></tt> file, which has options to pass to the nesC compiler. For
example, the mica2 .platform file tells ncc to look in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">chips/cc1000</span></tt>
and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">chips/atm128</span></tt> directories, as well as to use avr-gcc to compile a
mote binary (Teloi platforms tell it to use msp430-gcc).</p>
<p>Hardware abstractions in TinyOS 2.0 generally follow a three-level
abstaction heirarchy, called the HAA (Hardware Abstraction
Architecture).</p>
<p>At the bottom of the HAA is the HPL (Hardware Presentation Layer). The
HPL is a thin software layer on top of the raw hardware, presenting
hardare such as IO pins or registers as nesC interfaces. The HPL
generally has no state besides the hardware itself (it has no
variables). HPL components usually have the prefix <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Hpl</span></tt>, followed by
the name of the chip. For example, the HPL components of the CC1000
begin with <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">HplCC1000</span></tt>.</p>
<p>The middle of the HAA is the HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer). The HAL
builds on top of the HPL and provides higher-level abstractions that
are easier to use than the HPL but still provide the full
functionality of the underlying hardware. The HAL components usually have
a prefix of the chip name. For example, the HAL components of the CC1000
begin with <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">CC1000</span></tt>.</p>
<p>The top of the HAA is the HIL (Hardware Independent Layer). The HIL
builds on top of the HAL and provides abstractions that are hardware
independent. This generalization means that the HIL usually does not
provide all of the functionality that the HAL can. HIL components have
no naming prefix, as they represent abstractions that applications can
use and safely compile on multiple platforms. For example, the HIL
component of the CC1000 on the mica2 is <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ActiveMessageC</span></tt>, representing
a full active message communication layer.</p>
<p>The HAA is described in TEP 2: Hardware Abstraction Architecture[<a class="reference" href="#tep2">TEP2</a>].</p>
<p>Currently (as of the 2.0 release in November 2006), TinyOS 2.0 supports
the following platforms:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>eyesIFXv2</li>
<li>intelmote2</li>
<li>mica2</li>
<li>mica2dot</li>
<li>micaZ</li>
<li>telosb</li>
<li>tinynode</li>
<li>btnode3</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The btnode3 platform is not included in the RPM.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1><a id="scheduler" name="scheduler">3. Scheduler</a></h1>
<p>As with TinyOS 1.x, TinyOS 2.0 scheduler has a non-preemptive FIFO
policy. However, tasks in 2.0 operate slightly differently than in
1.x.</p>
<p>In TinyOS 1.x, there is a shared task queue for all tasks, and a
component can post a task multiple times. If the task queue is full,
the post operation fails. Experience with networking stacks showed
this to be problematic, as the task might signal completion of a
split-phase operation: if the post fails, the component above might
block forever, waiting for the completion event.</p>
<p>In TinyOS 2.x, every task has its own reserved slot in the task queue,
and a task can only be posted once. A post fails if and only if the
task has already been posted. If a component needs to post a task
multiple times, it can set an internal state variable so that when
the task executes, it reposts itself.</p>
<p>This slight change in semantics greatly simplifies a lot of component
code. Rather than test to see if a task is posted already before
posting it, a component can just post the task. Components do not have
to try to recover from failed posts and retry. The cost is one byte of
state per task. Even in large systems such as TinyDB, this cost is
under one hundred bytes (in TinyDB is is approximately 50).</p>
<p>Applications can also replace the scheduler, if they wish. This allows
programmers to try new scheduling policies, such as priority- or
deadline-based. It is important to maintain non-preemptiveness,
however, or the scheduler will break all nesC's static concurrency
analysis. Details on the new scheduler and how to extend it can be found
in TEP 106: Schedulers and Tasks[<a class="reference" href="#tep106">TEP106</a>].</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1><a id="booting-initialization" name="booting-initialization">4. Booting/Initialization</a></h1>
<p>TinyOS 2.0 has a different boot sequence than 1.x. The 1.x interface
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">StdControl</span></tt> has been split into two interfaces: <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Init</span></tt> and
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">StdControl</span></tt>. The latter only has two commands: <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">start</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">stop</span></tt>.
In TinyOS 1.x, wiring components to the boot sequence would cause them
to be powered up and started at boot. That is no longer the case: the
boot sequence only initializes components. When it has completed
initializing the scheduler, hardware, and software, the boot sequence
signals the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Boot.booted</span></tt> event. The top-level application component
handles this event and start services accordingly. Details on
the new boot sequence can be found in TEP 107: TinyOS 2.x Boot
Sequence[<a class="reference" href="#tep107">TEP107</a>].</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1><a id="virtualization" name="virtualization">5. Virtualization</a></h1>
<p>TinyOS 2.0 is written with nesC 1.2, which introduces the concept
of a 'generic' or instantiable component. Generic modules allow
TinyOS to have reusable data structures, such as bit vectors and
queues, which simplify development. More importantly, generic
configurations allow services to encapsulate complex wiring
relationships for clients that need them.</p>
<p>In practice, this means that many basic TinyOS services are now
<em>virtualized.</em> Rather than wire to a component with a parameterized
interface (e.g., GenericComm or TimerC in 1.x), a program instantiates
a service component that provides the needed interface. This
service component does all of the wiring underneath (e.g., in the
case of timers, to a unique) automatically, reducing wiring
mistakes and simplifying use of the abstraction.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1><a id="timers" name="timers">6. Timers</a></h1>
<p>TinyOS 2.0 provides a much richer set of timer interfaces than
1.x. Experience has shown that timers are one of the most critical
abstractions a mote OS can provide, and so 2.0 expands the fidelity
and form that timers take. Depending on the hardware resources of a
platform, a component can use 32KHz as well as millisecond granularity
timers, and the timer system may provide one or two high-precision
timers that fire asynchronously (they have the async
keyword). Components can query their timers for how much time
remainins before they fire, and can start timers in the future (e.g.,
'start firing a timer at 1Hz starting 31ms from now'). TEP 102:
Timers[<a class="reference" href="#tep102">TEP102</a>] defines what HIL components a platform must provide
in order to support standard TinyOS timers. Platforms are
required to provide millisecond granularity timers, and can provide
finer granularity timers (e.g., 32kHz) if needed.</p>
<p>Timers present a good example of virtualization in 2.0. In 1.x,
a program instantiates a timer by wiring to TimerC:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
components App, TimerC;
App.Timer -&gt; TimerC.Timer[unique(&quot;Timer&quot;)];
</pre>
<p>In 2.0, a program instantiates a timer:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
components App, new TimerMilliC();
App.Timer -&gt; TimerMilliC;
</pre>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1><a id="communication" name="communication">7. Communication</a></h1>
<p>In TinyOS 2.0, the message buffer type is <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">message_t</span></tt>, and it is a
buffer that is large enough to hold a packet from any of a node's
communication interfaces. The structure itself is completely opaque:
components cannot reference its fields. Instead, all buffer accesses
go through interfaces. For example, to get the destination address of
an AM packet named <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">msg</span></tt>, a component calls <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">AMPacket.destination(msg)</span></tt>.</p>
<p>Send interfaces distinguish the addressing mode of communication
abstractions. For example, active message communication has the
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">AMSend</span></tt> interface, as sending a packet require an AM destination
address. In contrast, broadcasting and collection tree abstractions
have the address-free <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Send</span></tt> interface.</p>
<p>Active messages are the network HIL. A platform's <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ActiveMessageC</span></tt>
component defines which network interface is the standard
communication medium. For example, a mica2 defines the CC1000 active
message layer as ActiveMessageC, while the TMote defines the CC2420
active message layer as ActiveMessageC.</p>
<p>There is no longer a TOS_UART_ADDRESS for active message
communication.  Instead, a component should wire to
SerialActiveMessageC, which provides active message communication over
the serial port.</p>
<p>Active message communication is virtualized through four generic
components, which take the AM type as a parameter: AMSenderC,
AMReceiverC, AMSnooperC, and AMSnoopingReceiverC. AMSenderC is
virtualized in that the call to send() does not fail if some
other component is sending (as it does with GenericComm in 1.x). Instead,
it fails only if that particular AMSenderC already has a packet
outstanding or if the radio is not in a sending state. Underneath,
the active message system queues and sends these outstanding packets.
This is different than the QueuedSendC approach of 1.x, in which there
is an N-deep queue that is shared among all senders. With N AMSenderC
components, there is an N-deep queue where each sender has a single
reserved entry. This means that each AMSenderC receives
1/n of the available post-MAC transmission opportunities,  where
n is the number of AMSenderC components with outstanding packets.
In the worst case, n is the number of components; even when every
protocol and component that sends packets is trying to send a packet,
each one will receive its fair share of transmission opportunities.</p>
<p>Further information on message_t can be found in TEP 111:
message_t[<a class="reference" href="#tep111">TEP111</a>], while further information on AM can be
found in TEP 116: Packet Protocols[<a class="reference" href="#tep116">TEP116</a>].</p>
<p>The current TinyOS release has a low-power stack for the CC1000
radio (mica2 platform) and an experimental low-power stack for
the CC2420 radio (micaz, telosb, and intelmote2 platforms).</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1><a id="sensors" name="sensors">8. Sensors</a></h1>
<p>In TinyOS 2.0, named sensor components comprise the HIL of a
platform's sensors. TEP 114 describes a set of HIL data acquisition
interfaces, such as Read, ReadStream, and Get, which sensors
provide according to their acquisition capabilities.</p>
<p>If a component needs
high-frequency or very accurate sampling, it must use the HAL, which
gives it the full power of the underlying platform (highly accurate
platform-independent sampling is not really feasible, due to the
particulars of individual platforms). <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Read</span></tt> assumes that the
request can tolerate some latencies (for example, it might schedule
competing requests using a FIFO policy).</p>
<p>Details on the ADC subsystem can be found in
TEP 101: Analog-to-Digital Converters[<a class="reference" href="#tep101">TEP101</a>]; details on
the organization of sensor boards can be found in TEP 109:
Sensorboards[<a class="reference" href="#tep109">TEP109</a>], and the details of the HIL sensor interfaces
can be found in TEP 114: Source and Sink Independent Drivers[<a class="reference" href="#tep114">TEP114</a>].</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1><a id="error-codes" name="error-codes">9. Error Codes</a></h1>
<p>The standard TinyOS 1.x return code is <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">result_t</span></tt>, whose value is
either SUCCESS (a non-zero value) or FAIL (a zero value). While this
makes conditionals on calls very easy to write (e.g., <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">if</span> <span class="pre">(call</span>
<span class="pre">A.b())</span></tt>), it does not allow the callee to distinguish causes of error
to the caller. In TinyOS 2.0, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">result_t</span></tt> is replaced by <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">error_t</span></tt>,
whose values include SUCCESS, FAIL, EBUSY, and ECANCEL. Interface
commands and events define which error codes they may return and why.</p>
<p>From the perspective of porting code, this is the most significant
different in 2.0. Calls that were once:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
if (call X.y()) {
  busy = TRUE;
}
</pre>
<p>now have their meanings reversed. In 1.x, the busy statement will execute
if the call succeeds, while in 2.0 it will execute if the call fails.
This encourages a more portable, upgradable, and readable approach:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
if (call X.y() == SUCCESS) {
  busy = TRUE;
}
</pre>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1><a id="arbitration" name="arbitration">10. Arbitration</a></h1>
<p>While basic abstractions, such as packet communication and timers,
can be virtualized, experiences with 1.x showed that some cannot
without either adding significant complexity or limiting the system.
The most pressing example of this is a shared bus on a microcontroller.
Many different systems -- sensors, storage, the radio -- might need
to use the bus at the same time, so some way of arbitrating access
is needed.</p>
<p>To support these kinds of abstractions, TinyOS 2.0 introduces
the Resource interface, which components use to request and
acquire shared resources, and arbiters, which provide a policy for
arbitrating access between multiple clients. For some abstractions,
the arbiter also provides a power management policy, as it can tell
when the system is no longer needed and can be safely turned off.</p>
<p>TEP 108: Resource Arbitration[<a class="reference" href="#tep108">TEP108</a>] describes the Resource interface
and how arbiters work.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1><a id="power-management" name="power-management">11. Power Management</a></h1>
<p>Power management in 2.0 is divided into two parts: the power state
of the microcontroller and the power state of devices. The former,
discussed in TEP 112: Microcontroller Power Management[<a class="reference" href="#tep112">TEP112</a>],
is computed in a chip-specific manner by examining which devices
and interrupt souces are active. The latter, discussed in
TEP 115: Power Management of Non-Virtualised Devices{<a class="reference" href="#tep115">TEP115</a>], is handled
through resource abiters. Fully virtualized services have their
own, individual power management policies.</p>
<p>TinyOS 2.0 provides low-power stacks for the CC1000 (mica2)
and CC2420 (micaz, telosb, imote2) radios. Both use a low-power
listening apporach, where transmitters send long preambles or
repeatedly send packets and receivers wake up periodically to
sense the channel to hear if there is a packet being
transmitted. The low-power stack CC1000 is standard, while
the CC2420 stack is experimental. That is, the default CC1000
stack (chips/cc1000) has low-power-listening, while the default
CC2420 stack (chips/cc2420) does not. To use the low-power CC2420
stack, you must include chips/cc2420_lpl in your application Makefile.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1><a id="network-protocols" name="network-protocols">12. Network Protocols</a></h1>
<p>TinyOS 2.0 provides simple reference implementations of two of
the most basic protocols used in mote networks: dissemination
and collection. Dissemination reliably delivers small (fewer
than 20 byte) data items to every node in a network, while
collection builds a routing tree rooted at a sink node. Together,
these two protocols enable a wide range of data collection
applications. Collection has advanced significantly since the
most recent beta release; experimental tests in multiple
network conditions have seen very high (&gt;98%) deliver rates
as long as the network is not saturated.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1><a id="conclusion" name="conclusion">13. Conclusion</a></h1>
<p>TinyOS 2.0 represents the next step of TinyOS development. Building on
user experiences over the past few years, it has taken the basic
TinyOS architecture and pushed it forward in several directions,
hopefully leading to simpler and easier application development. It is
still under active development: future prereleases will include
non-volatile storage, basic multihop protocols (collection routing,
dissemination), and further power management abstractions.</p>
