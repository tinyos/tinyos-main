<div class="subtitle">Last updated 30 October 2006</div>

<h1>Introduction</h1>      
<p>One of the frequently asked questions regarding TinyOS is, "Where is
	<code>main()</code>?".  In previous lessons, we deferred detailed
	discussion of the TinyOS boot sequence: applications handle the
	<tt>Boot.booted</tt> event and start from there. This tutorial
	describes the steps that occur before and after this event,
	showing how to properly initialize components.</p>

<h1>Boot Sequence</h1>
 
<p>The TinyOS boot sequence has four steps:
      <ol> 
	<li> Scheduler initialization</li>
	<li> Component initialization</li>
	<li> Signal that the boot process has completed</li>
	<li> Run the scheduler</li>
      </ol>

	The application-level boot sequence component is <tt>MainC</tt> (in tos/system).
	MainC provides one interface, <tt>Boot</tt> and uses one interface,
	<tt>Init as SoftwareInit</tt>. The boot sequence calls SoftwareInit.init() as
	part of step 2 and signals Boot.booted in step 3.</p>

      <p>The default real boot sequence is in the component <tt>RealMainP</tt>. Note
	that its name ends in P, denoting that components should not directly wire to
	it. This is RealMainP's signature:</p>

      
      <pre>
  module RealMainP {
    provides interface Booted;
    uses {
      interface Scheduler;
      interface Init as PlatformInit;
      interface Init as SoftwareInit;
    }
  }
      </pre>
      
      <p>MainC only provides Boot and uses SoftwareInit; RealMainP uses
	two additional interfaces, PlatformInit and Scheduler. MainC hides
	these from applications by automatically wiring them to the system's
	scheduler and platform initialization sequence. The difference between
	PlatformInit and SoftwareInit is predominantly one of hardware vs. software.
	PlatformInit is responsible for placing core platform services into
	meaningful states; for example, the PlatformInit of mica platforms
	calibrates their clocks.</p>

      <p>This is the code of RealMainP:</p>

      <pre>
  implementation {
    int main() __attribute__ ((C, spontaneous)) {
      atomic {
        call Scheduler.init();
        call PlatformInit.init();
        while (call Scheduler.runNextTask());
        call SoftwareInit.init();
        while (call Scheduler.runNextTask());
      }
      __nesc_enable_interrupt();
      signal Boot.booted();
      call Scheduler.taskLoop();
      return -1;
    }
    default command error_t PlatformInit.init() { return SUCCESS; }
    default command error_t SoftwareInit.init() { return SUCCESS; }
    default event void Boot.booted() { }
  }
</pre>

      <p>The code shows the four steps described above.</p>
	
<h2>Scheduler Initialization</h2>
<p>
The first boot step is to initialize the scheduler.
If the scheduler were not
initialized before the components, component initialization
routines would not be able to post tasks. While not all components
require tasks to be posted, this gives the flexibility required for
	those components that do. The boot sequence runs tasks after each
	  initialization stage in order to allow long-running operations,
	  since they only happen once. <A HREF="../tep106.html">TEP 106</A>
	describes TinyOS schedulers in greater detail, including information
	on how to replace the scheduler.</p>


<h2>Component initialization.</h2>

<p>After RealMainP initializes the scheduler,
it initializes the platform. The <code>Init</code> interface implements only
the single command <code>init()</code>. </p>

<pre></pre>
<prehead>tos/interfaces/Init.nc:</prehead>
<pre>

interface Init {
  command error_t init();
}
</pre>

<p>The platform initialization phase is the responsability of the platform
implementer. Thus, <code>PlatformInit</code> is wired to the
platform-specific initialization component, <code>PlatformC</code>. No
other component should be wired to <code>PlatformInit</code>.  Any
component that requires initialization can implement the <code>Init</code>
interface and wire itself to <code>MainC</code>'s <code>SoftwareInit</code>
interface:

<pre></pre>
<prehead>tos/system/MainC.nc:</prehead>
<pre>
configuration MainC {
  provides interface Boot;
  uses interface Init as SoftwareInit;
}
implementation {
  components PlatformC, RealMainP, TinySchedulerC;

  RealMainP.Scheduler -> TinySchedulerC;
  RealMainP.PlatformInit -> PlatformC;

  // Export the SoftwareInit and Booted for applications
  SoftwareInit = RealMainP.SoftwareInit;
  Boot = RealMainP;
}
</pre>

A common issue in initialization code is dependencies between different
parts of the system. These are handled in three ways in TinyOS:
<ul>
<li> Hardware-specific initialization issues are handled directly by
each platform's <code>PlatformC</code> component.

<li> System services (e.g., the timer, the radio) are typically written to
be independently initializable. For instance, a radio that uses a timer
does not setup the timer at radio initialisation time, rather it defers
that action until the radio is started. In other words, initialisation
is used to setup software state, and hardware state wholly owned by
the service.

<li> When a service is split into several components, the <code>Init</code>
interface for one of these components may well call <code>Init</code>
(and other) interfaces of the other components forming the service,
		  if a specific order is needed.
</ul>

<h2>Signal that the boot process has completed.</h2> 

<p>Once all
initialization has completed, <code>MainC</code>'s
<code>Boot.booted()</code> event is signaled. Components are now free to
call <code>start()</code> and other commands on any components they are
using. Recall that in the <code>Blink</code> application, the timers were
started from the <code>booted()</code> event. This <code>booted</code>
event is TinyOS's analogue of <code>main</code> in a Unix application.</p>

<h2>Run the scheduler loop.</h2> 
<p>Once the application has been informed
	    that the system as booted and started needed services, TinyOS
	    enters its core scheduling loop. The scheduler runs as long
	      as there are tasks on the queue. As soon as it detects an empty
	      queue, the scheduler puts the microcontroller into the lowest
	      power state allowed by the active hardware resources. For example,
	      only having timers running usually allows a lower power state than
	      peripheral buses like the UART. <A HREF="../tep112.html">TEP 112</A>
	      describes in detail how this process works.</p>

	    <p>The processor goes to sleep until it handles an interrupt. When
	      an interrupt arrives, the MCU exits its sleep state and runs the
	      interrupt handler. This causes the scheduler loop to restart. If
	      the interrupt handler posted one or more tasks, the scheduler runs
	      tasks until the task queue and then returns to sleep.</p>


	    <h1>Boot and SoftwareInit</h1>

	    <p>From the perspective of an application or high-level services, the two
	      important interfaces in the boot sequence are those which MainC exports:
	      Boot and SoftwareInit. Boot is typically only handled by the top-level application:
	      it starts services like timers or the radio. SoftwareInit, in contrast,
	      touches many difference parts of the system. If a component needs code
	      that runs once to initialize its state or configuration, then it can wire
	      to SoftwareInit.</p>

	    <p>Typically, service components that require intialization wire themselves
	      to SoftwareInit rather than depend on the application writer to do so. When
	      an application developer is writing a large, complex system, keeping track of
	      all of the initialization routines can be difficult, and debugging when one
	      is not being called can be very difficult. To prevent bugs and simplify
	      application development, services typically use <i>auto-wiring</i>.</p>

	    <p>The term auto-wiring refers to when a component automatically wires its
	      dependencies rather than export them for the application writer to resolve.
	      In this case, rather than provide the Init interface, a service component
	      wires its Init interface to RealMainC. For example, <tt>PoolC</tt> is a generic
	      memory pool abstraction that allows you to declare a collection of memory
	      objects for dynamic allocation. Underneath, its implementation (<tt>PoolP</tt>)
	      needs to initialize its data structures. Given that this must happen for
	      the component to operate properly, an application writer shouldn't have to
	      worry about it. So the PoolC component instantiates a PoolP and wires it
	      to MainC.SoftwareInit:

	    <pre>
generic configuration PoolC(typedef pool_t, uint8_t POOL_SIZE) {
  provides interface Pool<pool_t>;
} 

implementation {
  components MainC, new PoolP(pool_t, POOL_SIZE);

  MainC.SoftwareInit -> PoolP;
  Pool = PoolP;
}
</pre>

	      <p>In practice, this means that when MainP calls SoftwareInit.init,
		it calls Init.init on a large number of components. In a typical large
		application, the initialization sequence might involve as many as thirty
		components. But the application developer doesn't have to worry about this:
		properly written components take care of it automatically.</p>

<p><b>Programming Hint 8:</b> In the top-level 
configuration of a software abstraction, auto-wire Init to MainC. This removes the
burden of wiring Init from the programmer, which removes unnecessary work from the
boot sequence and removes the possibility of bugs from forgetting to wire.
