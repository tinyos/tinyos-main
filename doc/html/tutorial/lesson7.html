<div class="subtitle">Last Modified: April 13, 2007</div>

<p>This lesson introduces permanent (non-volatile) data storage in
TinyOS.  Permanent storage allows a node to persist data even if power
is disconnected or the node is reprogrammed with a new image.  You
will become familar with different kinds of data storage including
small objects, logs, and large objects.  You will be exposed to the
TinyOS interfaces and components that support permanent data storage
on motes and you will learn how to:

<p>

<ul>

<li>Divide the flash chip into volumes, which allows multiple and/or
different type of data to be stored.

<li>Store configuration data that survives a power cycle.

<li>Provide a link to example code using the logging abstraction.

<li>Provide a link to example code use large objects storage in
non-volatile flash.

</ul>


<h1>Introduction</h1>

TinyOS 2.x provides three basic storage abstractions: small objects,
circular logs, and large objects.  TinyOS 2.x also provides
<i>interfaces</i> to abstract the underlying storage services and
<i>components</i> that <i>provide</i> (implement) these interfaces.

<h2>Interfaces</h2>

Let's take a look at some of the interfaces that are in the
<code>tos/interfaces</code> directory and the types defined in the
<code>tos/types</code> to familiarize ourselves with the general
functionality of the storage system:


<p>
<ul>

<li><code>
<a href="../../../tos/interfaces/BlockRead.nc">BlockRead</a></code> 

<li><code>
<a href="../../../tos/interfaces/BlockWrite.nc">BlockWrite</a></code>

<li><code>
<a href="../../../tos/interfaces/Mount.nc">Mount</a></code>

<li><code>
<a href="../../../tos/interfaces/ConfigStorage.nc">ConfigStorage</a></code>

<li><code>
<a href="../../../tos/interfaces/LogRead.nc">LogRead</a></code>

<li><code>
<a href="../../../tos/interfaces/LogWrite.nc">LogWrite</a></code>

<li><code>
<a href="../../../tos/types/Storage.h">Storage.h</a></code>


</ul>

<h2>Components</h2>

<p>Components provide concrete implementations of the interfaces.  You
should be familiar with these components because your code needs to
specify both the <i>interfaces</i> your application
<i>uses</i> as well as the <i>components</i> which <i>provide</i>
(implement) these interfaces:

<p>
<ul>

<li><code><a href="../../../tos/chips/stm25p/ConfigStorageC.nc">ConfigStorageC</a></code>

<li><code><a href="../../../tos/chips/stm25p/LogStorageC.nc">LogStorageC</a></code>

<li><code><a href="../../../tos/chips/stm25p/BlockStorageC.nc">BlockStorageC</a></code>

</ul>

<p>

<h2>Naming Wrappers</h2>

<p>The preceding components are actually <em>naming wrappers</em>.
Since TinyOS supports multiple platforms, each of which might have its
own implementation of the storage drivers, platform-specific naming
wrappers are used to bridge the general storage interfaces to their
underlying, platform-specific implementations.

<p>For example, the preceding links are all specific to the ST
Microelectronics M25Pxx family of flash memories used in the Telos and
Tmote Sky motes.  You <em>do not</em> need to worry about the details
of where these files reside because TinyOS's make system includes the
correct drivers automatically.  However, you <em>do</em> need to know
what these components are called because your code must list them in a
<code>components</code> declaration.

<p>If you are curious, the following links will let you browse the
naming wrappers for the Atmel AT45DB family of flash memories used in
the Mica2/MicaZ motes:

<p>
<ul>

<li><code><a href="../../../tos/chips/at45db/ConfigStorageC.nc">ConfigStorageC</a></code>

<li><code><a href="../../../tos/chips/at45db/LogStorageC.nc">LogStorageC</a></code>

<li><code><a href="../../../tos/chips/at45db/BlockStorageC.nc">BlockStorageC</a></code>

</ul>

<p>Finally, the following links will let you browse the naming
wrappers for the Intel imote2 flash memory:

<p>
<ul>

<li><code><a href="../../../tos/platforms/intelmote2/ConfigStorageC.nc">ConfigStorageC</a></code>

<li><code><a href="../../../tos/platforms/intelmote2/LogStorageC.nc">LogStorageC</a></code>

<li><code><a href="../../../tos/platforms/intelmote2/BlockStorageC.nc">BlockStorageC</a></code>

</ul>


<h1>Volumes</h1>

<p>TinyOS 2.x divides a flash chip into one or more fixed-sized
<em>volume</em>s that are specified at compile-time using an XML file.
This file, called the volume table, allows the application developer
to specify the name, size, and (optionally) the base address of each
volume in the flash.  Each volume provides a single type of storage
abstraction (e.g. configuration, log, or block storage).  The
abstraction type defines the physical layout of data on the flash
memory.  A volume table might look like:

<pre>
&lt;volume_table&gt;
  &lt;volume name="CONFIGLOG" size="65536"/&gt;
  &lt;volume name="PACKETLOG" size="65536"/&gt;
  &lt;volume name="SENSORLOG" size="131072"/&gt;
  &lt;volume name="CAMERALOG" size="524288"/&gt;
&lt;/volume_table&gt;
</pre>

<p>The volume table for a particular application must be placed in the
application's directory (where one types 'make') and must be named
<code>volumes-CHIPNAME.xml</code> where CHIPNAME is replaced with the
platform-specific flash chip's name.  For example, the Telos mote uses
the ST Microelectronics M25P family of flash memories.  The drivers
for these chips can be found in the <code>tos/chips/stm25p</code>
directory.  Therefore, a Telos-based application that uses the storage
abstractions needs a file named <code>volumes-stm25p.xml</code>.

<p>Note that the size parameter is a multiple of the erase unit for a
particular flash chip.  See Section 4.1 in <a href="#fn1">TEP 103</a>
for more details.

<h1>Storing Configuration Data</h1>

<p>This lesson shows how configuration data can be written to and read
from non-volatile storage.  Configuration data typically exhibit some
subset of the following properties.  They are <b>limited in size</b>,
ranging from a fews tens to a couple hundred bytes.  Their values may
be <b>non-uniform</b> across nodes.  Sometimes, their values are
<b>unknown</b> prior to deployment in the field and sometimes their
values are <b>hardware-specific</b>, rather than being tied to the
software running on a node.

<p>Because configuration data can be non-uniform across nodes or
unknown <em>a priori</em>, their values may be difficult to specify at
compile-time and since the data are sometimes hardware-specific, their
values must survive reprogramming, suggesting that encoding these
values in the program image is not the simplest approach.  Storing
configuration data in volatile memory is also problematic since this
data would not survive a reset or power cycle.

<p>In summary, configuration data must persist through node resets,
power cycles, or reprogramming, and then be restored afterward.  The
ability to persist and restore configuration data in this manner is
useful in many scenarios.

<p><ul>

<li><b>Calibration.</b> Calibration coefficients for sensors might be
factory-configured and persisted, so they are not lost when power is
removed for shipping or the node is reprogrammed post-calibration.
For example, a hypothetical temperature sensor might have an offset
and gain that must be calibrated, because these parameters are
hardware-specific, and stored because they are needed to convert the
output voltage into the more useful units of degrees Celcius.  The
calibration data for such a sensor might look like:

<pre>
typedef struct calibration_config_t {
  int16_t temp_offset;
  int16_t temp_gain;
} calibration_config_t;
</pre>

<li><b>Identification.</b> Device identification information, like
IEEE-compliant MAC addresses or the TinyOS TOS_NODE_ID parameters are
non-uniform across nodes although they are not hardware-specific, once
they are assigned to a node, these values should be <em>sticky</em> in
that they are persisted across reset, power cycle, and reprogramming
operations (and not lost or reassigned to another node).

<pre>
typedef struct radio_config_t {
  ieee_mac_addr_t mac;
  uint16_t tos_node_id;
} radio_config_t;
</pre>

<li><b>Location.</b> Node location data may be unknown at compile-time
and only become available during deployment.  An application might,
for example, store node coordinates as follows and update these values
in the field:

<pre>
typedef struct coord_config_t {
  uint16_t x;
  uint16_t y;
  uint16_t z;
} coord_config_t;
</pre>

<li><b>Sensing.</b> Sensing and signal processing parameters like
sample period, filter coefficients, and detection thresholds might be
adjusted in the field.  The configuration data for such an application
might look like:

<pre>
typedef struct sense_config_t {
  uint16_t temp_sample_period_milli;
  uint16_t temp_ema_alpha_numerator;
  uint16_t temp_ema_alpha_denominator;
  uint16_t temp_high_threshold;
  uint16_t temp_low_threshold;
} sense_config_t;
</pre>

</ul>

<p>


Now that we have discussed <i>why</i> one might use this type of
storage, let's see <i>how</i> to use it.  We will implement a simple
demo application that illustrates how to use the <code>Mount</code>
and <code>ConfigStorage</code> abstractions.  A timer period will be
read from flash, divided by two, and written back to flash.  An LED is
toggled each time the timer fires.  But, before diving into code,
let's discuss some high-level design considerations.

<p>
See <a href="../../../apps/tutorials/BlinkConfig/">
<code>tinyos-2.x/apps/tutorials/BlinkConfig/</code></a> for the
accompanying code.

<p>

Prior to its first usage, a volume does not contain any valid data.
So, our code should detect the first usage of a volume and take any
appropriate actions (e.g. preload it with default values).  Similarly,
when the data layout of the volume changes (for example, if the
application requires new or different configuration variables), then
application code should detect this and take appropriate actions
(e.g. migrate the old data to the new layout or erase the volume and
reload the defaults).  These requirements suggest that we should have
a way of keeping track of the volume version.  We will use a version
number for this purpose (and will need to maintain a discipline of
updating the version number when the data layout changes
incompatibly).  Our configuration struct might have the following
fields for the version number and blink period:

<pre>
typedef struct config_t {
  uint16_t version;
  uint16_t period;
} config_t;
</pre>

<p>


<ol>

<li>Create a <code>volumes-CHIPNAME.xml</code> file, enter the volume
table in this file, and place the file in the application directory.
Note that <code>CHIPNAME</code> is the flash chip used on your target
plaform.  For example, <code>CHIPNAME</code> will be
<code>stm25p</code> for the Telos platform and <code>at45db</code> for
the MicaZ platform.  Our file will have the following contents:

<pre>
&lt;volume_table&gt;
  &lt;volume name="LOGTEST" size="262144"/&gt;
  &lt;volume name="CONFIGTEST" size="131072"/&gt;
&lt;/volume_table&gt;
</pre>

This volume information is used by the toolchain to create an include
file.  The auto-generated file, however, has to be included manually.
Place the following line in the configuration file which declares the
ConfigStorageC component (e.g. <code>BlinkConfigAppC.nc</code>):

<pre>
#include "StorageVolumes.h"
</pre>

<li>Config storage <em>uses</em> the <code>Mount</code> and
<code>ConfigStorage</code> interfaces (note that we rename
<code>ConfigStorage</code> to <code>Config</code>).

<pre>
module BlinkConfigC {
  uses {
    ...
    interface ConfigStorage as Config;
    interface Mount;
    ...
  }
}
</pre>

<li>Each interface must be wired to an <em>implementation</em> that
will provide it:

<pre>
configuration BlinkConfigAppC {
}
implementation {
  components BlinkConfigC as App;
  components new ConfigStorageC(VOLUME_CONFIGTEST); 
  ...

  App.Config     -> ConfigStorageC.ConfigStorage;
  App.Mount      -> ConfigStorageC.Mount;
  ...
}
</pre>

<li>Before the flash chip can be used, it must be mounted using the
two-phase mount/mountDone command.  Here we show how this might be
chained into the boot sequence:

<pre>
  event void Boot.booted() {
    conf.period = DEFAULT_PERIOD;

    if (call Mount.mount() != SUCCESS) {
      // Handle failure
    }
  }
</pre>

<li>If the Mount.mount succeeds, then the <code>Mount.mountDone</code>
event will be signaled.  The following code shows how to check if the
volume is valid, and if it is, how to initiate a read from the volume
using the <code>ConfigStore.read</code> command.  If the volume is
invalid, calling <code>Config.commit</code> will make it valid (this
call is also used to flush buffered data to flash much like the UNIX
fsync system call is supposed to flush buffered writes to disk):

<pre>
  event void Mount.mountDone(error_t error) {
    if (error == SUCCESS) {
      if (call Config.valid() == TRUE) {
        if (call Config.read(CONFIG_ADDR, &conf, sizeof(conf)) != SUCCESS) {
          // Handle failure
        }
      }
      else {
        // Invalid volume.  Commit to make valid.
        call Leds.led1On();
        if (call Config.commit() == SUCCESS) {
          call Leds.led0On();
        }
        else {
          // Handle failure
        }
      }
    }
    else{
      // Handle failure
    }
  }
</pre>


<li>If the read is successful, then a <code>Config.readDone</code>
event will occur.  In this case, we first check for a successful read,
and if successful, we then check the version number.  If the version
number matches what we expected, we copy of the configuration data to
a local variable, and adjust its values.  If there is a version
mismatch, we set the value of the configuration information to a
default value.  Finally, we call the the <code>Config.write</code>
function:

<pre>
  event void Config.readDone(storage_addr_t addr, void* buf, 
    storage_len_t len, error_t err) __attribute__((noinline)) {

    if (err == SUCCESS) {
      memcpy(&conf, buf, len);
      if (conf.version == CONFIG_VERSION) {
        conf.period = conf.period/2;
        conf.period = conf.period > MAX_PERIOD ? MAX_PERIOD : conf.period;
        conf.period = conf.period < MIN_PERIOD ? MAX_PERIOD : conf.period;
      }
      else {
        // Version mismatch. Restore default.
        call Leds.led1On();
        conf.version = CONFIG_VERSION;
        conf.period = DEFAULT_PERIOD;
      }
      call Leds.led0On();
      call Config.write(CONFIG_ADDR, &conf, sizeof(conf));
    }
    else {
      // Handle failure.
    }
  }

</pre>

<li>Data is not necessarily "written" to flash when
<code>ConfigStore.write</code> is called and
<code>Config.writeDone</code> is signaled.  To ensure data is
persisted to flash, a <code>ConfigStore.commit</code> call is
required:

<pre>
  event void Config.writeDone(storage_addr_t addr, void *buf, 
    storage_len_t len, error_t err) {
    // Verify addr and len

    if (err == SUCCESS) {
      if (call Config.commit() != SUCCESS) {
        // Handle failure
      }
    }
    else {
      // Handle failure
    }
  }
</pre>

<li>Finally, when the <code>Config.commitDone</code> event is
signaled, data has been durably written to flash and will survive a
node power cycle:

<pre>
  event void Config.commitDone(error_t err) {
    call Leds.led0Off();
    call Timer0.startPeriodic(conf.period);
    if (err == SUCCESS) {
      // Handle failure
    }
  }
</pre>

</ol>

<h1>Logging Data</h1>

Reliable (atomic) logging of events and small data items is a common
application requirement.  Logged data should not be lost if a system
crashes.  Logs can be either linear (stop logging when the volume is
full) or circular (overwrite the least recently written data when the
volume is full).

<p>

The TinyOS LogStorage abstraction supports these requirements. The log
is record based: each call to LogWrite.append (see below) creates a
new record.  On failure (a crash or power cycle), the log only loses
whole records from the end of the log.  Additionally, once a circular
log wraps around, log writes only lose whole records from the
beginning of the log.

<p>

A demo application called <code>PacketParrot</code> shows how to use
the <code>LogWrite</code> and <code>LogRead</code> abstractions.  A
node writes received packets to a circular log and retransmits the
logged packets (or at least the parts of the packets above the AM
layer) when power is cycled.

<p>

See <a href="../../../apps/tutorials/PacketParrot/">
<code>tinyos-2.x/apps/tutorials/PacketParrot/</code></a> for the
accompanying code.

<p>

The application logs packets it receives from the radio to flash.  On
a subsequent power cycle, the application transmits any logged
packets, erases the log, and then continues to log packets again.  The
red LED is on when the log is being erased.  The blue (yellow) LED
turns on when a packet is received and turns off when a packet has
been logged successfully.  The blue (yellow) LED remains on when
packets are being received but are not logged (because the log is
being erased).  The green LED flickers rapidly after a power cycle
when logged packets are transmitted.


<ol>

<li>The first step when using the log is to decide what kind of data
you want to store in the log.  In this case, we will declare a struct
of the type:

<pre>
  typedef nx_struct logentry_t {
    nx_uint8_t len;
    message_t msg;
  } logentry_t;
</pre>

<li>Unlike Config storage, Log storage does not require the volume to
be explicitly mounted by the application.  Instead, a simple read
suffices in which a buffer and the number of bytes to read are passed
to <code>LogRead.read</code>:

<pre>
  event void AMControl.startDone(error_t err) {
    if (err == SUCCESS) {
      error_t e;
      do {
        e = call LogRead.read(&m_entry, sizeof(logentry_t));
      } while (e != SUCCESS);
    }
    else {
      call AMControl.start();
    }
  }
</pre>

<li>If the call to <code>LogRead.read</code> returns SUCCESS, then a
<code>LogRead.readDone</code> event will be signaled shortly
thereafter.  When that happens, we check if the data that was returned
is the same length as what we expected.  If it is, we use the data but
if not, we assume that either the log is empty or that we have lost
synchronization, so the log is erased:

<pre>

  event void LogRead.readDone(void* buf, storage_len_t len, error_t err) {
    if ( (len == sizeof(logentry_t)) && (buf == &m_entry) ) {
      call Send.send(&m_entry.msg, m_entry.len);
      call Leds.led1On();
    }
    else {
      error_t e;
      do {
        e = call LogWrite.erase();
      } while (e != SUCCESS);
      call Leds.led0On();
    }
  }

</pre>

<li>The <code>PacketParrot</code> application stores packets received
over the radio to flash by first saving the <code>message_t</code> and
its length to a <code>log_entry_t</code> struct and then calling
<code>LogWrite.append</code>:

<pre>
  event message_t* Receive.receive(message_t* msg, void* payload, uint8_t len){
    call Leds.led2On();
    if (!m_busy) {
      m_busy = TRUE;
      m_entry.len = len;
      m_entry.msg = *msg;
      if (call LogWrite.append(&m_entry, sizeof(logentry_t)) != SUCCESS) {
        m_busy = FALSE;
      }
    }
    return msg;
  }
</pre>

<li>If the <code>LogWrite.write</code> returned SUCCESS, then a short
time later, a <code>LogWrite.appendDone</code> will be signaled.  This
event returns the details of the write including the source buffer,
length of data written, whether any records were lost (if this is a
circular buffer) and any error code.  If no errors occurred, then the
data was written to flash with atomicity, consistency, and durability
guarantees (and will survive node crashes and reboots):

<pre>
  event void LogWrite.appendDone(void* buf, storage_len_t len, 
                                 bool recordsLost, error_t err) {
    m_busy = FALSE;
    call Leds.led2Off();
  }

</pre>

</ol>

<h1>Storing Large Objects</h1>

Block storage is generally used for storing large objects that cannot
easily fit in RAM.  Block is a low-level system interface that
requires care when using since it is essentially a write-once model of
storage.  Rewriting requires an erase which is time-consuming, occurs
at large granularity (e.g. 256 B to 64 KB), and can only happen a
limited number of times (e.g. 10,000 to 100,000 times is typical).
The TinyOS network reprogramming system uses Block storage to store
program images.

<p>

See <a href="../../../apps/tests/storage/Block/">
<code>tinyos-2.x/apps/tests/storage/Block/</code></a> for an example
of code that uses the Block storage abstraction.
