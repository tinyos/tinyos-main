    <p>This lesson demonstrates how to use the <code>printf</code> library located in 
    tos/lib/printf to debug TinyOS applications by printing messages over the serial 
    port.</p>
    
    <h1>Overview</h1>
    <p> 
    Anyone familiar with TinyOS knows that debugging applications has 
    traditionally been a very arduous, if not stressful process.  While simulators
    like TOSSIM can be used to help verify the logical correctness of a program, 
    unforseen problems inevitably arise once that program is deployed on 
    real hardware.  Debugging such a program typically involves flashing the 
    three available LEDs in some intricate sequence or resorting to line by line 
    analysis of a running program through the use of a JTAG.
    </p>
    <p>
    It is common practice when developing desktop applications to print output 
    to the terminal screen for debugging purposes. While tools such as 
    <code>gdb</code> provide means of stepping though a program line by line,
    often times developers simply want to quickly print something to the screen 
    to verify that the value of a variable has been set correctly, or determine 
    that some sequence of events is being run in the proper order.  It would be 
    absurd to suggest that they only be allowed three bits of information in order
    to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
    The TinyOS <code>printf</code> library provides this terminal printing functionality 
    to TinyOS applications through motes connected to a pc via their serial interface.
    Messages are printed by calling 
    <code>printf</code> commands using a familiar syntax borrowed from the C programming 
    language.  In order to use this functionality, developers simply need to include 
    a single component in their top level configuration file (<code>PrintfC</code>),
    and include a <code>"printf.h"</code> header file in any components that actually call 
    <code>printf()</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
    Currently, the <code>printf</code> library is only supported on msp430 and atmega128x 
    based platforms (e.g. mica2, micaZ, telos, eyesIFX).  In the future we hope to add 
    support for other platforms as well.  
    </p>
    <h1>The TinyOS <code>printf</code> Library</h1>
    This section provides a basic overview of the TinyOS <code>printf</code> library,
    including the components that make it up and the interfaces they provide.
    In the following section we walk you through the process of actually using these components
    to print messages from a mote to your pc.  If you dont care how <code>printf</code>
    works and only want to know how to use it, feel free to skip ahead to the next section.
    <hr></hr>
    The entire <code>printf</code> library consists of only 4 files located
    in the <code>tos/lib/printf</code> directory: one module,
    one configuration, one interface file, and one header file.
    <br><br>
    <ul>
      <li><b>PrintfC.nc</b>      -- Configuration file providing printf functionality to TinyOS applications
      <li><b>PrintfP.nc</b>      -- Module implementing the printf functionality
      <li><b>PrintfFlush.nc</b>  -- Interface for flushing printf messages over the serial port to a pc
      <li><b>printf.h</b>        -- Header file specifying the printf message format and size of the flush buffer</pre>
    </ul>
    <p>
    The <code>PrintfC</code> configuration is the only component an application needs to wire
    in order to use the functionality provided by the TinyOS <code>printf</code>
    library.  Below is the component graph of the <code>PrintfC</code> configuration:
    </p>
    <center><img src=img/printf_components.png></img><p><b>Figure 1: The component
    graph of the PrintfC configuration.</b></p></center>
    <p>
    Conceptually, the operation of the TinyOS <code>printf</code> library is very
    simple.  Developers supply strings to <code>printf()</code> commands in a
    distributed fashion throughout any of the components that make up a complete
    TinyOS application.  These strings are buffered in a central location inside
    the <code>PrintfP</code> component and flushed out to a PC in the form of
    TinyOS SerialMessages upon calling the <code>flush()</code> command of the
    <code>PrintfFlush</code> interface.
    </p>
    <p>
    By encapsulating the strings produced by calls to <code>printf()</code> inside
    standard TinyOS SerialMessages, applications that use the serial stack for
    other purposes can share the use of the serial port.  Alternate
    implementations were considered in which <code>printf</code> would have
    had exclusive access to the serial port, and explicit flushing would not have
    been necessary.  In the end, we felt it was better to give developers the
    freedom to decide exactly when messages should be printed, as well as allow them
    to send multiple types of SerialMessages in a single application.
    </p>
    <p>
    Currently, only a single buffer is used to store the strings supplied to
    calls to <code>printf</code> before flushing them.  This means that while
    the buffer is being flushed, any calls to <code>printf</code> will fail.
    In the future, we plan to implement a doubled buffer approach so that
    strings can continue to be buffered at the same time they are being printed.
    </p>
    <p>
    There are also plans to provide a means of flushing messages out to a PC
    without requiring developers to make an explicit <code>flush()</code> call.
    This would allow developers to simply wire in the <code>PrintfC</code> component
    without having to make any calls to any interfaces it provides.  In fact,
    the <code>PrintfC</code> component would not need to provide any interfaces
    at all.  It would start itself up and then run in a loop, periodically
    flushing the contents of the <code>printf</code> buffer.
    Such functionality is useful in applications that do not really care when
    messages are printed or how long a delay the process of printing introduces
    to other sections of code.  Explicit flushing would still be recommended in
    applications where the sections of code under examinatation are very timing
    sensitive (e.g. inside the CC2420 radio stack).
    </p>
    <h1>Using the TinyOS <code>printf</code> Library</h1>

    <p>
    To help guide the process of using the <code>printf</code> library, a
    <code>TestPrintf</code> application has been created.
    At present, this application is not included in
    the official TinyOS distribution (<= 2.0.2).  If you are using TinyOS
    from a cvs checkout, you will find it located under
    <code>apps/tests/TestPrintf</code>.  Otherwise, you can obtain it from
    cvs by running the following set of commands from a terminal window:
    </p>

    <pre>
cd $TOSROOT/apps/tests
cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@tinyos.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/tinyos login
cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@tinyos.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/tinyos co -P -d TestPrintf tinyos-2.x/apps/tests/TestPrintf</pre>
    <p>
    Just hit enter when prompted for a CVS password.  You do not need to enter one.
    </p>
    <hr></hr>

    <p>
    The <code>TestPrintf</code> application demonstrates everything necessary
    to use the <code>printf</code> library.  Go ahead and open the
    <code>TestPrintfAppC</code> configuration to see how the various interfaces
    provided by the <code>PrintfC</code> component have been wired in. You will
    want to do something similar in your own applications.

    <pre>
configuration TestPrintfAppC{
}
implementation {
  components MainC, TestPrintfC, LedsC;
  components PrintfC;

  TestPrintfC.Boot -> MainC;
  TestPrintfC.Leds -> LedsC;
  TestPrintfC.PrintfControl -> PrintfC;
  TestPrintfC.PrintfFlush -> PrintfC;
}</pre>

    <p>
    First, the <code>PrintfControl</code> interface has been wired in to enable turning on and
    off the service providing <code>printf</code> functionality.  Turning on
    the <code>Printf</code> service implicity
    turns on the serial port for sending messages.  Second, the <code>PrintfFlush</code>
    interface has been wired in to allow the application to control when
    <code>printf</code> messages should be flushed out over the serial line.  In this
    application, all <code>printf()</code> commands are called directly within the
    <code>TestPrintfC</code> component.  In general, <code>printf()</code> commands can be
    called from any component as long as they have included the <code>"printf.h"</code>
    header file.
    </p>
    <hr></hr>
    <p>
    Before examining the <code>TestPrintfC</code> component, first install the
    application on a mote and see what kind of output it produces.
    Note that the instructions here are only valid for installation on a telosb mote
    on a linux based TinyOS distribution.
    For installation on other systems or for other mote platforms, please refer to
    <a href="lesson1.html"> lesson 1</a> for detailed instructions.
    </p>
    <p>
    To install the application on the mote, run the following set of commands.
    </p>
    <pre>
cd $TOSROOT\apps\tests\TestPrintf
make telosb install bsl,/dev/ttyUSBXXX</pre>
    <p>
    You will notice during the installation process that a pair of java files are
    compiled along with the TinyOS application.  The first java file,
    <code>PrintfMsg.java</code>, is generated by <code>mig</code>
    to encapsulate a TinyOS <code>printf</code> message received over the serial
    line (for more information on mig and how it generates these files, please refer
    to the section entitled "MIG: generating packet objects" in
    <a href=lesson4.html>lesson 4</a>).  The second file, <code>PrintfClient.java</code>
    is used to read <code>printf</code> messages received from a mote and print
    them to your screen.
    </p>
    <p>
    To see the output generated by <code>TestPrintf</code> you need to start the
    <code>PrintfClient</code> by running the following command:
    </p>
    <pre>
cd $TOSROOT\apps\tests\TestPrintf
java PrintfClient -comm serial@/dev/ttyUSBXXX:telosb</pre>

    <p>
    After resetting the mote, the following output should be printed to your screen:
    </p>
    <pre>
Hi I am writing to you from my TinyOS application!!
Here is a uint8: 123
Here is a uint16: 12345
Here is a uint32: 1234567890
I am now iterating: 0
I am now iterating: 1
I am now iterating: 2
I am now iterating: 3
I am now iterating: 4
This is a really short string...
I am generating this string to have just less than 250
characters since that is the limit of the size I put on my
maximum buffer when I instantiated the PrintfC component.
Only part of this line should get printed bec</pre>

    <p>
    Note that the 'tty' device (i.e. COM port) specified when starting the PrintfClient
    MUST be the one used for communicating with a mote over the serial line.  On telos
    and mica motes this is the same port that the mote is programmed from.  Other motes,
    such as eyesIFX, have one port dedicated to programming and another for
    communication. Just make sure you use the correct one.
    </p>
    <p>
    If for some reason you do not receive the output shown above, please refer
    to <a href=lesson4.html>lesson 4</a> to verify you have done everything
    necessary to allow serial communication between your pc and the mote.  Remember
    that when using the MIB510 programming board that the switch on the very front
    of the board must be set to the <font style=bold>OFF</font> position in order to send
    messages from the mote to the pc.
    </p>
    <hr></hr>
    <p>
    Go ahead and open up <code>TestPrintfC</code> to see how this output is being generated.
    </p>
    <p>
    Upon receiving the booted event, the <code>Printf</code> service is started via a call to
    <code>PrintfControl.start()</code>
    </p>
    <pre>
event void Boot.booted() {
  call PrintfControl.start();
}</pre>
    <p>
    Once the <code>Printf</code> service has been started, a
    <code>PrintfControl.startDone()</code> event is generated.  In the body of this event
    the first four
    lines of output are generated by making successive calls to <code>printf</code>
    and then flushing the buffer they are stored in.
    </p>
    <pre>
event void PrintfControl.startDone(error_t error) {
  printf("Hi I am writing to you from my TinyOS application!!\n");
  printf("Here is a uint8: %u\n", dummyVar1);
  printf("Here is a uint16: %u\n", dummyVar2);
  printf("Here is a uint32: %ld\n", dummyVar3);
  call PrintfFlush.flush();
}</pre>
    <p>
    Once these first four lines have been flushed out, the <code>PrintfFlush.flushDone()</code>
    event is signaled.  The body of this event first prints the next 5 lines in a loop,
    followed by the last five lines.  Finally, once all lines have been printed, the
    <code>Printf</code> service is stopped via a call to <code>PrintfControl.stop()</code>.
    </p>
    <pre>
event void PrintfFlush.flushDone(error_t error) {
  if(counter < NUM_TIMES_TO_PRINT) {
    printf("I am now iterating: %d\n", counter);
    call PrintfFlush.flush();
  }
  else if(counter == NUM_TIMES_TO_PRINT) {
    printf("This is a really short string...\n");
    printf("I am generating this string to have just less <font color=red>...</font>
    printf("Only part of this line should get printed bec <font color=red>...</font>
    call PrintfFlush.flush();
  }
  else call PrintfControl.stop();
  counter++;
}</pre>
    <p>
    Notice that the last line of output is cut short before being fully printed.
    If you actually read the line printed above it you can see why.  The buffer
    used to store TinyOS <code>printf</code> messages before they are flushed
    is limited to a total of 250 bytes.  If you try and print more characters than
    this before flushing, then only the first 250 characters will actually be printed.
    As of now, this buffer size is fixed and can't be changed.  In the future we
    hope to allow developers to specify custom buffer sizes at the time that
    they include the PrintfC component in their configuration file.
    </p>
    <p>
    Once the the <code>Printf</code> service has been stopped, the
    <code>PrintfControl.stopDone()</code> event is signaled and Led 2 is turned
    on to signify that the application has terminated.
    </p>
    <pre>
  event void PrintfControl.stopDone(error_t error) {
    counter = 0;
    call Leds.led2Toggle();
    printf("This should not be printed...");
    call PrintfFlush.flush();
  }
    </pre>
    <p>
    Notice that the call to <code>printf()</code> inside the body of the
    <code>PrintfControl.stopDone()</code> event never produces any output.
    This is because the <code>Printf</code> service has been stopped before
    this command is called.
    </p>
    <h1>Conclusion</h1>
    <p>
    A few points are worthy of note before jumping in and writing your own applications that
    use the functionality provided by the <code>printf</code> library.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>The buffer used by the <code>printf</code> library is limited to 250 bytes.
          Do NOT try and increase this value.  It is unclear why, but at present,
          larger buffer sizes result in messages being cut short when printed over the
          serial line.  Tracking down
          the source of this problem is on our list of things to do.</li>
      <li>In order to use the <code>printf</code> library, the <code>tos/lib/printf</code>
          directory must be in your include path.  The easiest way to include it is
          by adding the following line directly within the Makefile of your top
          level application:
          <pre>
CFLAGS += -I$(TOSDIR)/lib/printf</pre></li>
    </ol>

<p>
Hopefully you now have everything you need to get going with the TinyOS <code>printf</code>
library.  All questions (or comments) about the use of this library should be directed to
<a href=mailto:tinyos-help@millennium.berkeley.edu>tinyos-help</a> mailing list.
