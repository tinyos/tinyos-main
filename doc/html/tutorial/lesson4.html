    <div class="title">Lesson 4: Mote-PC serial communication and SerialForwarder</div>
    <div class="subtitle">Last updated June 27 2006</div>

<p>To goal of this lesson is to show you how to communicate with a
mote from a PC. This will allow you to collect data from the network,
send commands to motes, and monitor network traffic.</p>

<p>This tutorial presents the Java-based infrastructure for communicating
with motes. There is also a C-based infrastructure, found in support/sdk/c.
Please see the documentation found there, and the <code>mig</code> and 
<code>ncg</code> man pages for more details.


<h1>Packet sources and TestSerial</h1>

<p>The first step is to check that you are able to get your PC to 
communicate with a mote. Most motes have a serial port or similar
interface. For example, the mica family can directly control a serial
port: programming boards basically connect the mote's serial port
pins to the actual serial port on the board. Telos motes also have
a serial interface, but it talks to their USB hardware, which
is similar in functionality but very different in terms of cables and
connectors.</p>

<p>The basic abstraction for mote-PC communication is a <b>packet
source</b>. A packet source is exactly that: a communication medium
over which an application can receive packets from and send packets to
a mote. Examples of packet sources include serial ports, TCP sockets,
and the SerialForwarder tool. Most TinyOS communication tools take
an optional <code>-comm</code> parameter, which allows you to 
specify the packet source as a string. For example:</p>

<pre>
$ java net.tinyos.tools.Listen -comm serial@COM1:telos
</pre>

<p>tells the Listen tool to use the COM1 serial port (on a Windows
machine) at the correct speed for a telos mote, while</p>

<pre>
$ java net.tinyos.tools.Listen -comm serial@/dev/ttyS0:micaz
</pre>

<p>tells Listen to use the serial port <code>/dev/ttyS0</code> (on
a UNIX machine) at the correct speed for a micaz mote.</p>

<p>The first step to testing your serial port is to install
the <code>apps/tests/TestSerial</code> application on a mote. This 
application sends a packet to the serial port every second,
and when it receives a packet over the serial port it displays
the packet's sequence number on the LEDs.</p>

<p>Once you have installed <code>TestSerial</code>, you need
to run the corresponding Java application that communicates with
it over the serial port. This is built when you build the TinyOS
application. From in the application directory, type:</p>

<pre>
$ java TestSerial
</pre>

If you get a message like
<pre>
The java class is not found:  TestSerial
</pre>
it means that you either haven't compiled the Java code (try running <code>
make <i>platform</i></code> again) or you don't have <code>.</code> (the
current directory) in your Java <code>CLASSPATH</code>.

<p>Because you haven't specified a packet source, TestSerial
will fall back to a default, which is a SerialForwarder. Since
you don't have a SerialForwarder running, TestSerial will
exit, complaining that it can't connect to one. So let's specify
the serial port as the source. The syntax for a serial port 
source is as follows:</p>

<pre>
   serial@&lt;PORT&gt;:&lt;SPEED&gt;
</pre>

<p>PORT depends on your platform and where you have plugged the mote in.
For Windows/Cygwin platforms, it is COM<i>N</i>, where <i>N</i> is the port
number. For Linux/UNIX machines, it is <code>/dev/ttyS</code><i>N</i> for a
built-in serial port, or one of <code>/dev/ttyUSB<i>N</I></code> or
<code>/dev/usb/tts/<i>N</I></code> for a serial-over-USB port. Additionally
as we saw in <a href="lesson1.html">lesson 1</a>, on Linux you will
typically need to make this serial port world writeable.  As superuser,
execute the following command:
<pre>chmod 666 <i>serialport</i></pre>
<p>

<p>The SPEED
can either be a numeric value, or the name of a platform. Specifying a
platform name tells the serial packet source to use the default speed for
the platform. Valid platforms are:</p>

<CENTER>
<table>
<tr><td>Platform</td><td>Speed (baud)</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan=2><hr></td></tr>
<tr><td>telos</td><td>115200</td></tr>
<tr><td>telosb</td><td>115200</td></tr>
<tr><td>tmote</td><td>115200</td></tr>
<tr><td>micaz</td><td>57600</td></tr>
<tr><td>mica2</td><td>57600</td></tr>
<tr><td>mica2dot</td><td>19200</td></tr>
<tr><td>eyes</td><td>115200</td></tr>
<tr><td>intelmote2</td><td>115200</td></tr>
</table>
</center>
<br>

<p>The Java file <tt>support/sdk/java/net/tinyos/packet/BaudRate.java</tt>
determines these mappings. Unlike in TinyOS 1.x, all platforms have a common
serial packet format. Following the table, these two serial 
specfications are identical:</p>

<pre>
serial@COM1:micaz
serial@COM1:57600
</pre>

<p>If you run <code>TestSerial</code> with the proper PORT and SPEED
settings, you should see output like this:</p>

<pre>
Sending packet 1
Received packet sequence number 4
Sending packet 2
Received packet sequence number 5
Sending packet 3
Received packet sequence number 6
Sending packet 4
Received packet sequence number 7
Received packet sequence number 8
Sending packet 5
Received packet sequence number 9
Sending packet 6
</pre>

<p>and the mote LEDs will blink.</p>

<h2>Cannot find JNI error</h2>

<p>If you try to run TestSerial and receive an error that Java cannot find
TOSComm JNI support, this means the Java Native Interface (JNI) files that
control the serial port haven't been correctly installed. Run the command
<code>tos-install-jni</code> (on Linux, do this as the superuser). If this
command does not exist, go to <code>tinyos-2.x/tools/tinyos/java</code>. If
the directory has a <code>Makefile</code> in it, type <code>make</code>
and (again, on Linux, as superuser) <code>make
install</code>.  If the directory does not have a <code>Makefile</code>, go
to <code>tinyos-2.x/tools</code> and type:</p>

<pre>
$ ./Bootstrap
$ ./configure
$ ./make
$ ./make install
</pre>

<p>Then type <code>tos-install-jni</code>. This should install
serial support in your system.</p>

<h2>MOTECOM</h2>

<p>If you do not pass a
<code>-comm</code> parameter, then tools will check the 
<code>MOTECOM</code> environment variable for a packet source,
and if there is no <code>MOTECOM</code>, they default to a
SerialForwarder. This means that if you're always communicating
with a mote over your serial port, you can just set <code>MOTECOM</code>
and no longer have to specify the <code>-comm</code> parameter.
For example:</p>

<pre>
export MOTECOM=serial@COM1:19200 # mica baud rate
export MOTECOM=serial@COM1:mica  # mica baud rate, again
export MOTECOM=serial@COM2:mica2 # the mica2 baud rate, on a different serial port
export MOTECOM=serial@COM3:57600 # explicit mica2 baud rate
</pre>

<p>Try setting your MOTECOM variable and running TestSerial without
a <code>-comm</code> parameter.</p>


<h1>BaseStation and net.tinyos.tools.Listen</h1>

<p><code>BaseStation</code> is a basic TinyOS utility application.
It acts as a bridge between the serial port and radio network.
When it receives a packet from the serial port,
it transmits it on the radio; when it receives a packets over
the radio, it transmits it to the serial port. Because TinyOS
has a toolchain for generating and sending packets to a mote
over a serial port, using a BaseStation allows PC tools to
communicate directly with mote networks.</p>

<p>Take one of the two nodes that had BlinkToRadio (from <a href="lesson3.html">lesson 3</a>) installed
and install BaseStation on it. If you turn on the node that still
has BlinkToRadio installed, you should see LED 1 on the BaseStation
blinking. BaseStation toggles LED 0 whenever it sends a packet 
to the radio and LED 1 whenever it sends a packet to the 
serial port. It toggles LED 2 whenever it has to drop a packet:
this can happen when one of the two receives packets faster
than the other can send them (e.g., receiving micaZ radio packets
at 256kbps but sending serial packets at 57.6kbps).</p>

<p>BaseStation is receiving your BlinkToRadio packets and sending
them to the serial port, so if it is plugged into a PC we can
view these packets. The Java tool Listen is a basic packet
sniffer: it prints out the binary contents of any packet it hears.
Run Listen, using either MOTECOM or a -comm parameter:</p>

<pre>
$ java net.tinyos.tools.Listen
</pre>

<p>Listen creates a packet source and just prints out every
packet it sees. Your output should look something like this:</p>

<pre>
00 FF FF 04 22 06 00 02 00 01
00 FF FF 04 22 06 00 02 00 02
00 FF FF 04 22 06 00 02 00 03
00 FF FF 04 22 06 00 02 00 04
00 FF FF 04 22 06 00 02 00 05
00 FF FF 04 22 06 00 02 00 06
00 FF FF 04 22 06 00 02 00 07
00 FF FF 04 22 06 00 02 00 08
00 FF FF 04 22 06 00 02 00 09
00 FF FF 04 22 06 00 02 00 0A
00 FF FF 04 22 06 00 02 00 0B
</pre>


<p>Listen is simply printing out the packets that are coming from the
mote. Each data packet that comes out of the mote contains several fields
of data. The first byte (00) indicates that this is packet is an AM
packet. The next fields are the generic Active Message fields, defined in
<tt>tinyos-2.x/tos/serial/Serial.h</tt>.  Finally, the remaining fields are
the data payload of the message, which was defined in BlinkToRadio.h as:</p>

<pre>
typedef nx_struct BlinkToRadioMsg {
  nx_uint16_t nodeid;
  nx_uint16_t counter;
} BlinkToRadioMsg;
</pre>

The overall message format for the BlinkToRadioC application is
therefore (ignoring the first 00 byte): </p>
<ul>
  <li> <b>Destination address</b> (2 bytes)</li>
  <li> <b>Message length</b> (1 byte)</li>
  <li> <b>Group ID</b> (1 byte)</li>
  <li> <b>Active Message handler type</b> (1 byte)</li>
  <li> <b>Payload</b> (up to 28 bytes):</li>
  <ul>
    <li> <b>source mote ID</b> (2 bytes)</li>
    <li> <b>sample counter</b> (2 bytes)</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
So we can interpret the data packet as follows:
<table hspace="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="10" border="0">
  <tbody>
    <tr bgcolor="#d0d0d0">
      <td><b>dest addr</b></td>
      <td><b>msg len</b></td>
      <td><b>groupID</b></td>
      <td><b>handlerID</b></td>
      <td><b>source addr</b></td>
      <td><b>counter</b></td>
    </tr>    <tr>
      <td bgcolor="#d0d0ff">ff ff</td>
      <td bgcolor="#d0d0ff">04</td>
      <td bgcolor="#d0d0ff">22</td>
      <td bgcolor="#d0d0ff">06</td>
      <td bgcolor="#d0ffd0">00 02</td>
      <td bgcolor="#d0ffd0">00 0B</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>The source address depends on what mote ID you installed your
BlinkToRadio application with. The default (if you do not specify
and ID) is <code>00 01</code>.
Note that the data is sent by the mote in <i>big-endian</i>
format;  for example, <code>01 02</code> means 258 (256*1 + 2).
This format is independent of the endian-ness of the processor,
because the packet format is an <code>nx_struct</code>, which is
a network format, that is, big-endian and byte-aligned. Using
<code>nx_struct</code> (rather than a standard C <code>struct</code>)
for a message payload ensures that it will work across platforms.</p>

<p>As you watch the packets scroll by, you should see the counter
field increase as the BlinkToRadio app increments its counter.</p>

<h1>MIG: generating packet objects</h1>

<p>The <tt>Listen</tt> program is the most basic way of communicating
with the mote; it just prints binary packets to the screen. Obviously 
it is not easy to visualize the sensor data
using this program. What we'd really like is a better way of retrieving
and observing data coming from the sensor network. Of course, exactly
what data to display and how to visualize it can be very application 
specific. For this reason, TinyOS only 
has a few applications for visualizing simple
sensor data (in the next lesson, you'll use the Oscilloscope application), 
but it provides support for building new visualization or logging systems.
</p> 

<p>One problem with Listen is that it just dumps binary data: a user has
to be able to read the bytes and parse them into a given packet format.
The TinyOS toolchain makes this process easier by providing tools for
automatically generating message objects from packet descriptions.
Rather than parse packet formats manually, you can use the <code>mig</code>
(Message Interface Generator) tool to build a Java, Python, or C interface
to the message structure. Given a sequence of bytes, the MIG-generated
code will automatically parse each of the fields in the packet, and it
provides a set of standard accessors and mutators for printing out 
received packets or generating new ones.</p>

<p>The mig tool takes three basic arguments: what programming language
to generate code for (Java, Python, or C), which file in which to find
the structure, and the name of the structure. The tool also takes standard
C options, such as -I for includes and -D for defines. The TestSerial
application, for example, uses mig so that it can easily create
and parse the packets over the serial port. If you go back to TestSerial
and type <code>make clean;make</code>, you should see this:</p>

<pre>
rm -rf build *.class TestSerialMsg.java
rm -rf _TOSSIMmodule.so TOSSIM.pyc TOSSIM.py
mkdir -p build/telosb
mig java -target=telosb -I%T/lib/oski -java-classname=TestSerialMsg TestSerial.h TestSerialMsg -o TestSerialMsg.java
javac *.java

msp430-objcopy --output-target=ihex build/telosb/main.exe build/telosb/main.ihex
    writing TOS image
</pre>

<p>Before building the TinyOS application, the Makefile has a rule
for generating <code>TestSerialMsg.java</code>. It then compiles
TestSerialMsg.java as well as TestSerial.java, and finally
compiles the TinyOS application. Looking at the Makefile, we can see
that it has a few more rules than the one for BlinkToRadio:</p>

<pre>
COMPONENT=TestSerialAppC
BUILD_EXTRA_DEPS += TestSerial.class
CLEAN_EXTRA = *.class TestSerialMsg.java

TestSerial.class: $(wildcard *.java) TestSerialMsg.java
        javac *.java

TestSerialMsg.java:
        mig java -target=null -java-classname=TestSerialMsg TestSerial.h TestSerialMsg -o $@

include $(MAKERULES)
</pre>

<p>The <code>BUILD_EXTRA_DEPS</code> line tells the TinyOS make system
that the TinyOS application has additional dependencies that must
be satisfied before it can be built. The Makefile tells the make system
that <code>TestSerial.class</code>, the Java application that we ran
to test serial communication. The <code>CLEAN_EXTRA</code> line tells
the make system extra things that need to be done when a user types
<code>make clean</code> to clean up.</p>

<p>The <code>BUILD_EXTRA_DEPS</code> line tells make to compile 
TestSerial.class before the application; the line</p>

<pre>
TestSerial.class: $(wildcard *.java) TestSerialMsg.java
        javac *.java
</pre>

<p>tells it that TestSerial.class depends on all of the .java files 
in the directory as well as TestSerialMsg.java. Once all of these
dependencies are resolved, the make system will call <code>javac
*.java</code>, which creates TestSerial.class. The final line,</p>

<pre>
TestSerialMsg.java:
        mig java -target=null -java-classname=TestSerialMsg TestSerial.h TestSerialMsg -o $@
</pre>

<p>tells the make system how to create TestSerialMsg.java, the
Java class representing the packet sent between the mote and PC.
Because TestSerialMsg.java is a dependency for TestSerial.class,
make will create it if it is needed. To create TestSerialMsg.java,
the Makefile invokes the mig tool. Let's step through the parameters
one by one:</p>

<table>
<tr>  <td>mig</td>  <td width=60></td>                <td>Invoke mig</td> </tr>
<tr>  <td>java</td> <td></td>                         <td>Build a Java class</td> </tr>
<tr>  <td>-target=null</td> <td></td>          	      <td>For the <code>null</code>platform</td></tr>
<tr>  <td>-java-classname=TestSerialMsg</td><td></td> <td>Name the Java class TestSerialMsg</td> </tr>
<tr>  <td>TestSerial.h</td>        <td></td>          <td>The structure is in TestSerial.h</td> </tr>
<tr>  <td>TestSerialMsg</td>      <td></td>           <td>The structure is named TestSerialMsg</td></tr>
<tr>  <td>-o $@</td>               <td></td>          <td>Write the file to $@, which is TestSerialMsg.java</tr></tr>
</table>

<p>The <code>null</code> platform is a special platform which is convenient to use
as the target when using <code>mig</code>. It includes all the standard
system components, but with dummy do-nothing implementations. Building an
application for the <code>null</code> platform is useless, but it allows
<code>mig</code> to extract the layout of packets.

<p>Let's build a Java packet object for BlinkToRadio.  Open the Makefile for 
BlinkToRadio and add a dependency:</p>

<pre>
BUILD_EXTRA_DEPS=BlinkToRadioMsg.class
</pre>

<p>Then add a step which explains how to compile a .java to a .class:</p>

<pre>
BlinkToRadioMsg.class: BlinkToRadioMsg.java
        javac BlinkToRadioMsg.java
</pre>

<p><b>Note that there must be a tab before javac, and not just spaces.</b>
Finally, add the line which explains how to create BlinkToRadioMsg.java:</p>

<pre>
BlinkToRadioMsg.java:
        mig java -target=null -java-classname=BlinkToRadioMsg BlinkToRadio.h BlinkToRadioMsg -o $@
</pre>

<p>As with javac, there must be a tab (not spaces) before mig. 
Now, when you type <code>make</code> in <code>BlinkToRadio/</code>, 
the make system will compile BlinkToRadioMsg.class, a Java class
that parses a binary packet into message fields that can be accessed
through methods.</p>

<p>There is one more step, however. When you compiled, you probably saw this warning:

<pre>
warning: Cannot determine AM type for BlinkToRadioMsg
         (Looking for definition of AM_BLINKTORADIOMSG)
</pre>

<p>One part of the TinyOS communication toolchain requires being able to
figure out which AM types correspond to what kinds of packets.
To determine this, for a packet type named X, mig looks for a constant
of the form <code>AM_X</code>. The warning is because we defined our
AM type as AM_BLINKTORADIO, but mig wants AM_BLINKTORADIOMSG. Modify
BlinkToRadio.h so that it defines the latter. You'll also need to
update BlinkToRadioAppC.nc so that the arguments to AMSenderC
and AMReceiverC use it. Recompile the application, and you should
see no warning. Install it on a mote.</p>

<p>Now that we have a Java message class, we can use it to
print out the messages we see from the BaseStation. With 
BaseStation plugged into the serial port and BlinkToRadio
running on another mote, from the BlinkToRadio directory
type</p>

<pre>
java net.tinyos.tools.MsgReader BlinkToRadioMsg
</pre>

<p>Now, when the BaseStation sends a packet to the serial
port, MsgReader reads it, looks at its AM type, and if
it matches the AM type of one of the Java message classes
passed at the command line, it prints out the packet. You
should see output like this:</p>

<pre>
1152232617609: Message <BlinkToRadioMsg>
  [nodeid=0x2]
  [counter=0x1049]

1152232617609: Message <BlinkToRadioMsg>
  [nodeid=0x2]
  [counter=0x104a]

1152232617609: Message <BlinkToRadioMsg>
  [nodeid=0x2]
  [counter=0x104b]

1152232617621: Message <BlinkToRadioMsg>
  [nodeid=0x2]
  [counter=0x104c]
</pre>

<h1>SerialForwarder and other packet sources</h1>

<p>One problem with directly using the serial port is that
only one PC program can interact with the mote. Additionally,
it requires you to run the application on the PC which is
physically connected to the mote. The SerialForwarder tool
is a simple way to remove both of these limitations.</p>

<p>Most generally, the <tt>SerialForwarder</tt> program 
opens a packet source and lets many applications connect
to it over a TCP/IP stream in order to use that source. 
For example, you can run a SerialForwarder whose packet
source is the serial port; instead of connecting to the
serial port directly, applications connect to the 
SerialForwarder, which acts as a proxy to read and write
packets. Since applications connect to SerialForwarder
over TCP/IP, applications can connect over the Internet.</p>

<p>SerialForwarder is the second kind of packet source.
A SerialForwarder source has this syntax:</p>

<pre>
sf@HOST:PORT
</pre>

<p>HOST and PORT are optional: they default to localhost (the
local machine) and 9002. For example,</p>

<pre>
sf@dark.cs.berkeley.edu:1948
</pre> 

<p>will connect to a SerialForwarder running on the computer
dark.cs.berkeley.edu and port 1948.</p>

<p>The first step is to run a SerialForwarder; since it
takes one packet source and exports it as an sf source,
it takes a packet source parameter just like the other
tools we've used so far: you can pass a -comm parameter,
use MOTECOM, or just rely on the default. Close your
MsgReader application so that it no longer uses
the serial port, and run a SerialForwarder:</p>

<pre>
java net.tinyos.sf.SerialForwarder
</pre>

<p>You should see a window like this pop up:

<center>
<p><img height="300" width="500" src="img/sf.gif"></p>
</center>

<p>Since SerialForwarder takes any packet source as its source, you
can even string SerialForwaders along:</p>

<pre>
java net.tinyos.sf.SerialForwarder -port 9003 -comm sf@localhost:9002
</pre>

<p>This command opens a second SerialForwarder, whose source is the first
SerialForwarder. You'll see that the client count of the first one has
increased to one. It's rare that you'd ever want to do this, but it
demonstrates that in the message support libraries you can 
use a variety of packet sources.</p>

<p>Close the second SerialForwarder (the one listening on port 9003).
Run MsgReader again, but this time tell it to connect to your
SerialForwarder:</p>

<pre>
java net.tinyos.tools.MsgReader -comm sf@localhost:9002 BlinkToRadioMsg
</pre>

<p>You will see the client count increment, and MsgReader will start
printing out packets.</p>

<h2>Packet Sources</h2>

<p>In addition to serial ports and SerialForwarders, the TinyOS
messaging library supports a third packet source, motes which
are connected to an ethernet port through a Crossbow MIB 600 
ethernet board. This is the full
set of packet sources:

<br>
<center>
<table>
<tr>
<td><b>Syntax</b></td>
<td width=100></td>
<td><b>Source</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>serial@PORT:SPEED</td>
<td></td>
<td>Serial ports</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>sf@HOST:PORT</td>
<td></td>
<td>SerialForwarder, TMote Connect</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>network@HOST:PORT</td>
<td></td>
<td>MIB 600</td>
</tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>In the <code>network</code> packet source, the default MIB 600 port
is 10002. The Moteiv TMote Connect appliance is a SerialForwarder
packet source.</p>

<h2>The tool side</h2>

<p>Code for the Java messaging toolchain lives in two java packages:
<code>net.tinyos.message</code> and <code>net.tinyos.packet</code>.
The <code>packet</code> package contains all of the code for 
packet sources and their protocols: it is what reads and writes
bytes. The <code>message</code> package is what turns streams of
bytes into meaningful messages and provides packet source independent
classes for communicating with motes.</p>

<p>The key class for sending and receiving packets is <code>MoteIF</code>.
It has methods for registering packet listeners (callbacks when a packet
arrives) and sending packets. The tools <code>MsgReader</code>,
<code>Listen</code>, and <code>Send</code> are good places to start
to learn how to get Java applications to communicate with motes.</p>

<p>There is also support for python and C.</p>

<h1>Sending a packet to the serial port in TinyOS</h1>

<p>Sending an AM packet to the serial port in TinyOS is very
much like sending it to the radio. A component uses the AMSend
interface, calls <code>AMSend.send</code>, and handles
<code>AMSend.sendDone</code>. The serial stack will send
it over the serial port regardless of the AM address specified.</p>

<p>The TinyOS serial stack follows the same programming model as the radio
stack. There is a <code>SerialActiveMessageC</code> for turning
the stack on and off (mote processors often cannot enter their
lowest power state while the serial stack is on), and generic
components for sending and receiving packets. As the serial
stack is a dedicated link, however, it does not provide a
snooping interface, and it does not filter based on the destination
address of the packet. These are the serial communication components
and their radio analogues:</p>

<p>Because serial AM communication has the same interfaces as radio
AM communication, you can in most situations use them interchangably.
For example, to make BlinkToRadio send packets to the serial port
rather than the radio, all you have to do is change the
BlinkToRadioAppC configuration:</p>

<center>
<table>
 <tr><td><b>Radio</b></td><td width=10></td><td><b>Serial</b></td></tr>
 <tr><td>
<pre>
  components ActiveMessageC;
  components new AMSenderC(AM_BLINKTORADIOMSG);

  BlinkToRadioC.AMSend -> AMSenderC;
  BlinkToRadioC.AMControl -> ActiveMessageC;
</pre>
</td>
<td></td>
<td>
<pre>
  components SerialActiveMessageC;
  components new SerialAMSenderC(AM_BLINKTORADIOMSG);

  BlinkToRadioC.AMSend -> SerialAMSenderC;
  BlinkToRadioC.AMControl -> SerialActiveMessageC;
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</center>
</table>
<br>
<hr>

<p>Now, rather than have BlinkToRadio send packets which a BaseStation
recieves and forwards to the serial port, the application will
send them directly to a serial port. Connect a MsgReader to test
that this is happening. Note that the binary code and data size
has changed significantly, as nesC has included the serial stack
rather than the radio stack.</p>

<h1>CLASSPATH and Java classes</h1>
			
<p>Note that the CLASSPATH variable points to <tt>tinyos.jar</tt>. This
means that when Java looks for classes to load, it looks in tinyos.jar rather
than the Java directories in <tt>support/sdk/java</tt>. Therefore,
if you change and recompile the Java classes, you will not see the changes,
as Java will only look at the jar file. To regenerate the
jar from the Java code, go to <tt>support/sdk/java</tt> and type
<tt>make tinyos.jar</tt>.
