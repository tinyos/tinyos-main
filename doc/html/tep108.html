<h1><a id="abstract" name="abstract">Abstract</a></h1>
<p>This memo documents the general resource sharing mechanisms for TinyOS
2.x. These mechanisms are used to allow multiple software components to
arbitrate access to shared abstractions.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1><a id="introduction" name="introduction">1. Introduction</a></h1>
<p>TinyOS 1.x has two mechanisms for managing shared resources:
virtualization and completion events. A virtualized resource appears
as an independent instance of an abstraction, such as the Timer
interface is TimerC. A client of a Timer instance can use it
independently of the others: TimerC virtualizes the underlying
hardware clock into N separate timers.</p>
<p>Some abstractions, however, are not well suited to virtualization:
programs need the control provided by a physical abstraction. For
example, components in 1.x share a single communication stack,
GenericComm.  GenericComm can only handle one outgoing packet at a
time. If a component tries to send a packet when GenericComm is
already busy, then the call returns FAIL. Therefore, shared use of
GenericComm follows a first-come, first-served arbitration policy. If
a component sends a packet but GenericComm is busy, the component
needs a way to tell when GenericComm is free so it can retry. TinyOS
1.x provides the mechanism of a global completion event which is
signalled whenever a packet send completes. Interested components can
handle this event and retry.</p>
<p>The approach to physical (rather than virtualized) abstractions
has several drawbacks:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>If you need to make several requests, you have to handle the
possibility of a request returning FAIL at any point. This complicates
implementations by adding internal states.</li>
<li>You have no control over the timing of a sequence of operations. One
example of when this can be a problem is timing-sensitive use of an
A/D converter.</li>
<li>If a hardware resource supports reservation, you cannot express this
via this software interface. For instance, I2C buses have a
concept of &quot;repeated start&quot; when doing multiple bus transactions,
but it is not clear how to use this in TinyOS 1.x's I2C abstraction.</li>
<li>Most TinyOS 1.x services do not provide a very convenient way of
monitoring an abstractions's availability for the purpose of retries,
nor very clear documentation of which requests could happen simultaneously.</li>
</ul>
<p>A single approach to resource sharing is not appropriate for all
circumstances. For instance, requiring resource reservation allows
programs to have better timing guarantees for access to an A/D converter.
But if a program does not need precise timing guarantees (e.g., when measuring
temperature in a biological monitoring application), this extra resource
reservation step unnecessarily complicates code.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1><a id="resource-classes" name="resource-classes">2. Resource Classes</a></h1>
<p>TinyOS 2.x distinguishes between three kinds of abstractions:
<em>dedicated</em>, <em>shared</em>, and <em>virtualized</em>.
Components offer resource sharing mechanisms appropriate to their
goals and level of abstraction. As discussed in Section 2.1, access
control to dedicated abstractions is generally handled
through nesC interfaces. As discussed in Section 2.2, access control
to virtualized abstractions is handled through software design
patterns such as the Service Instance <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id9" id="id1" name="id1">[3]</a> and/or
queueing. Section 2.3 addresses with the most complex class of
abstraction, shared, while Section 3 describes the
components and interfaces used to arbitrate access to this class.</p>
<p>Hardware Presentation Layer (HPL) components of the HAA <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id7" id="id2" name="id2">[1]</a> are not
virtual, as virtualization inevitably requires state. Depending on their
expected use, HPL abstractions are either dedicated or
shared. For example, while hardware timers are rarely
multiplexed between multiple components, buses almost always are.
For example, on the MSP430 microcontroller, compare and counter registers are
dedicated, while the USARTs are shared.</p>
<div class="section">
<h2><a id="dedicated" name="dedicated">2.1 Dedicated</a></h2>
<p>An abstraction is <em>dedicated</em> if it is a resource
which a subsystem needs exclusive access to at all times. Examples of
dedicated abstractions include interrupts and counters.
Generally, a physical and dedicated abstraction is just an interface
which its user wires to. For example, on the Atmega128, Timer 2 is
presented by the component HplAtm128Timer2C:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
module HplAtm128Timer2C {
  provides {
    interface HplTimer&lt;uint8_t&gt;   as Timer2;
    interface HplTimerCtrl8       as Timer2Ctrl;
    interface HplCompare&lt;uint8_t&gt; as Compare2;
  }
}
</pre>
<p>Dedicated abstractions MAY be annotated with the nesC attribute
&#64;atmostonce or &#64;exactlyonce is to provide compile-time checks that
their usage assumptions are not violated.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h2><a id="virtual" name="virtual">2.2 Virtual</a></h2>
<p><em>Virtual</em> abstractions hide multiple clients from each other
through software virtualization. Every client of the resource thinks it
has its own independent instance of the resource, but these virtualized
instances are multiplexed on top of a single underlying resource. Because
the virtualization is in software, there is no upper bound on the number
of clients of the abstraction, barring memory or efficiency constraints.
For example, the TimerMilliC component provides a virtual and shared
abstraction of millisecond precision timers to application
components <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id8" id="id3" name="id3">[2]</a>. As virtualization usually requires keeping state
that scales with the number of virtualized instances,
virtualized resources often use the Service Instance pattern <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id9" id="id4" name="id4">[3]</a>,
which is based on a parameterized interface. For example, HilTimerMilliC
provides multiple virtualized timer clients and auto-wires the
chip timer implementation (HilTimerMilliC <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id8" id="id5" name="id5">[2]</a>) to the boot initialization
sequence:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
configuration TimerMilliP {
  provides interface Timer&lt;TMilli&gt; as TimerMilli[uint8_t num];
}
implementation {
  components HilTimerMilliC, MainC;
  MainC.SoftwareInit -&gt; HilTimerMilliC;
  TimerMilli = HilTimerMilliC;
}
</pre>
<p>while TimerMilliC encapsulates this in a generic configuration:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
generic configuration TimerMilliC {
  provides interface Timer&lt;TMilli&gt;;
}
implementation {
  components HilTimerMilliC;
  Timer = HilTimerMilliC.Timer[unique(UQ_TIMER_MILLI)];
}
</pre>
<p>Virtualization generally allows a client to use a very simple interface.
This simplicity comes at a cost of reduced efficiency and an inability to
precisely control the underlying resource. For example, TimerMilli32C
introduces CPU overhead from dispatching and maintaining all of the
virtual timers as well as jitter from when two timers want to fire at
the same time.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h2><a id="shared" name="shared">2.3 Shared</a></h2>
<p>Dedicated abstractions are useful when a resource is
always controlled by a single component. Virtualized abstractions are
useful when clients are willing to pay a bit of overhead and sacrifice
control in order to share a resource in a simple way. There are
situations, however, when many clients need precise control of a
resource. Clearly, they can't all have such control at the same time:
some degree of multiplexing is needed.</p>
<p>In TinyOS 2.x, a resource <em>arbiter</em> is responsible for this
multiplexing. The arbiter determines which client has access to the
resource. While a client holds a resource, it has complete and
unfettered control. Arbiters assume that clients are cooperative, only
acquiring the resource when needed and holding on to it no longer than
necessary. Clients explicitly release resources: there is no way for
an arbiter to forcibly reclaim it.</p>
<p>A motivating example of a shared resource is a bus.
The bus may have multiple peripherals on it, corresponding to
different subsystems. For example, on the Telos platform the flash
chip (storage) and the radio (network) share a bus. The storage and
network stacks need exclusive access to the bus when using it,
but they also need to share it with the other subsystem. In this
case, virtualization is problematic, as the radio stack needs to be
able to perform a series of operations in quick succession without
having to reacquire the bus in each case. Having the bus be a
physical but shared resource allows the radio stack to
send a series of operations atomically across to the radio without
having to buffer them all up in memory beforehand (which would
introduce memory pressure).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1><a id="resource-arbiters" name="resource-arbiters">3. Resource Arbiters</a></h1>
<p>Every shared resource has an arbiter to manage which client
can use the resource at any given time. Because an arbiter is a
centralized place that knows whether the resource is in use, it also
provides information useful for a variety of other services, such as
power management. An arbiter MUST provide a parameterized Resource
interface as well as an instance of the ArbiterInfo interface. An
arbiter SHOULD also provide an instance of ResourceController and
ResourceConfigure interfaces. An arbiter MAY provide additional
interfaces or instance of interfaces in order to provide a particular
arbitration policy.</p>
<div class="section">
<h2><a id="resource" name="resource">3.1 Resource</a></h2>
<p>Clients of a shared resource arbiter request access
with the Resource interface:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
interface Resource {
  async command error_t request();
  async command error_t immediateRequest();
  event void granted();
  async command void release();
}
</pre>
<p>A client lets an arbiter know it needs access to the resource with
a call to request(). The arbiter signals the granted() event to a
client when it gains exclusive access to the resource. A client
can also acquire the resource with immediateRequest(). The
return value of this call determines whether the client was able
to acquire the resource. If immmediateRequest() does not successfully
acquire the resource (does not return SUCCESS), then it can try to do
so in the standard,
split-phase way with request(). If the call to immediateRequest()
returns SUCCESS, then the arbiter MUST NOT issue a granted() event.</p>
<p>An arbiter MUST provide a parameterized Resource interface,
where the parameter is a client ID, following the Service
Instance pattern <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id9" id="id6" name="id6">[3]</a>. An arbitrated component SomeNameC MUST
#define SOME_NAME_RESOURCE to a string which can be passed to unique()
to obtain a client id. For instance, an I2C bus might look like this:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
includes I2CPacketC;
configuration I2CPacketC {
  provides {
    interface Resource[uint8_t id];
    interface I2CPacket[uint8_t busId];
  }
} ...
</pre>
<p>where I2CPacketC.h contains the #define for the resource:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
#ifndef I2CPACKETC_H
#define I2CPACKETC_H
#define I2CPACKET_RESOURCE &quot;I2CPacket.Resource&quot;
#endif
</pre>
<p>The #define for the unique string must be placed in a separate file
because of the way nesC files are preprocessed: referring to I2CPacketC
isn't enough to ensure that macros #define'd in I2CPacketC are visible
in the referring component.</p>
<p>For example, clients of the I2C service might use it as follows:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
module I2CUserM {
  uses interface Resource as I2CResource;
  uses interface I2CPacket;
} ...

#include &lt;I2CPacketC.h&gt;
configuration I2CUserC { }
implementation {
  components I2CUserM, I2CPacketC;

  I2CUserM.I2CResource -&gt; I2CPacketC.Resource[unique(I2C_RESOURCE)];
  I2CUserM.I2CPacket -&gt; I2CPacket.I2CPacket[0x73]; // using I2C device 0x73
}
</pre>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h2><a id="resourcecontroller" name="resourcecontroller">3.2 ResourceController</a></h2>
<p>An arbiter SHOULD provide one instance of the ResourceController
interface and MAY provide more than one. The Resource interface is for
simple and basic use cases, where clients are peers that share the
resource in some equal fashion. ResourceController is for clients that
require additional information due to the policies of the arbiter and
how they use the resource.  The ResourceController interface is based
on Resource, but introduces two additional events, idle() and
requested():</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
interface ResourceController {
  async command error_t request();
  async command error_t immediateRequest();
  event void granted();
  async command void release();
  async event void requested();
  async event void idle();
}
</pre>
<p>An arbiter signals the requested event if the client currently has the resource
and some other client has requested it. It signals the idle() event when
no client holds the resource.</p>
<p>ResourceController allows an arbiter to provide a much richer set of
policies than simple sharing. For example, arbiters that want to
incorporate a power management policy can provide ResourceController
for a power management component. The power management component can
detect when nobody is using the resource with idle(), acquire it
atomically with immediateRequest(), and power it down. When another
client requests the resource, the power manager will handle the
requested() event. It can then power up the resource and release it
when the power up completes. Note that if power up is a split-phase
operation (takes a while), then calls by clients to immediateRequest()
when in powered down state will not return SUCCESS. See TEP 115 for
details. The default arbiters in TinyOS 2.x (see Section 4) all provide a
single instance of ResourceController, in order to enable power
management as described above.</p>
<p>ResourceController can also be used for special case clients: the
algorithm used to determine when its requests are handled in
comparison to instances of Resource is arbiter specific. Therefore,
arbiters MAY provide one or more instances of ResourceController.  For
example, the FcfsPriorityArbiter has a single high-priority client who
is always granted access to the resource before any other client.
Other clients only obtain the resource if the high-priority client has
not requested it or when the high-priority client releases it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h2><a id="arbiterinfo" name="arbiterinfo">3.3 ArbiterInfo</a></h2>
<p>Arbiters MUST provide an instance of the ArbiterInfo interface.
The ArbiterInfo interface allows a component to query the current
status of an arbiter:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
interface ArbiterInfo {
  async command bool inUse();
  async command uint8_t userId();
}
</pre>
<p>The ArbiterInfo interface has a variety of uses. For example, the resource
implementation can use it to refuse requests from clients that do not
currently have access. In this case, the abstraction would need to provide
a parameterized interface for its operations so it could distinguish separate
clients, and the client ID for its operations would need to be the same
as the client ID for the arbiter.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h2><a id="resourceconfigure" name="resourceconfigure">3.4 ResourceConfigure</a></h2>
<p>The ResourceConfigure interface provides a mechanism for clients that need
to use a resource with different configurations. Rather than forcing a
client to reconfigure the resource itself, the component representing a
client can wire to an arbiter's ResourceConfigure interface, which is called
before the client is granted the resource.</p>
<p>For example, the MSP430 USART0 bus can operate in three modes: SPI, I2C, and
UART. Using all three concurrently is problematic: only one should be enabled
at a time. However, different clients of the bus might need different bus
protocols. For example, Telos sensors use an I2C, while the radio and flash
chip use SPI.</p>
<p>Arbiters MAY use a parameterized ResourceConfigure interface:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
interface ResourceConfigure {
  async command void configure();
  async command void unconfigure();
}
</pre>
<p>The parameter is the client ID, and corresponds directly to an instance of
the Resource interface. For example:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
generic component RoundRobinArbiterC {
  provides {
    interface Resource[uint8_t id];
    interface ResourceController;
    interface ArbiterInfo;
  }
  uses {
    interface ResourceConfigure[uint8_t id];
  }
}
</pre>
<p>If an arbiter uses the ResourceConfigure interface, before it signals the
Resource.granted() event and before it returns SUCCESS from a call to
Resource.immediateRequest(), it MUST call ResourceConfigure.configure() on
the granted client ID. Similarly, after a valid call to Resource.release(),
it MUST call ResourceConfigure.unconfigure() on the releasing client ID.</p>
<p>Using a parameterized interface that calls out rather than a decorator
on the Resource interface simplifies code reuse. Using a decorator
could lead to a large number of clients all including redundant
configuration code, while the call out will only have one instance
of the code. For example, an SPI client might look like this:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
generic component Msp430Spi0ClientC {
  provides {
    interface Resource;
    interface SPIByte;
    interface SPIPacket;
  }
}
implementation {
  enum {MSP430_SPI0_CLIENT = unique(MSP430_USART_RESOURCE);
  components Msp430Usart0C, Msp430Spi0Configure as Configure;

  Resource = Msp430Usart0C.Resource[MSP430_SPI0_CLIENT];
  Msp430Usart0C.ResourceConfigure[MSP430_SPI0_CLIENT] -&gt; Configure;
}
</pre>
<p>Arbiters SHOULD provide a parameterized ResourceConfigure interface.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h2><a id="cross-component-reservation" name="cross-component-reservation">3.5 Cross-component reservation</a></h2>
<p>In some cases, it is desirable to share reservation of resources
across components. For example, on the TI MSP430, the same pins can
be used as an I2C bus, a UART, or an SPI connection. Clearly, on this
chip, a reservation of the I2C bus implicitly reserves the
corresponding UART and SPI.  This can be accomplished in the framework
described above by:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>using the same unique string for all three resources</li>
</ol>
<p>2) wiring the three parameterised Resource interfaces to the same
arbiter</p>
<p>The common way to do this is as follows (the UART and SPI components
are omitted, they are similar to I2CC,  low-level I2C component):</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
#define I2C_RESOURCE MSP_BUS_RESOURCE
configuration I2CC {
  provides interface Resource[uint8_t clientId];
  provides interface I2C;
}
implementation {
  components MspBusC, I2CM;

  Resource = MspBusC.Resource;
  I2C = I2CM.I2C;
}
</pre>
<p>MspBusC (the arbiter for the MSP bus):</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
#define MSP_BUS_RESOURCE &quot;MspBus.Resource&quot;
configuration {
  provides interface Resource[uint8_t clientId];
} ...
</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1><a id="implementation" name="implementation">4. Implementation</a></h1>
<p>Because most components use one of a small number of arbitration
policies, TinyOS includes a number of default resource arbiters. These
arbiters can be found in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">tinyos-2.x/tos/system</span></tt> and are all
generic components that include this signature:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
generic module ArbiterC {
  provides interface Resource[uint8_t id];
  provides interface ResourceController;
  provides interface ArbiterInfo;
  uses interface ResourceConfigure[uint8_t id];
}
</pre>
<p>For example, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">RoundRobinArbiterC</span></tt> provides round-robin arbitration. This
arbiter assigns a fixed order to all clients and grants outstanding
requests in that order, which is based on client ID. <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">FcfsArbiterC</span></tt>
provides a FIFO order, where requests are serviced in the order they
are received. <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">FcfsPriorityArbiterC</span></tt> is similar to FcfsArbiterC, but
provides an additional ResourceController interface for the
high-priority client.</p>
