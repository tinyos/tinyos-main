requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.  Distribution

TEP 1.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="abstract">
<h1><a name="abstract">Abstract</a></h1>
<p>This memo documents how sensor drivers are organized in TinyOS and how
sets of sensor drivers are combined into sensor boards and sensor
platforms, along with general principles followed by the components
that provide access to sensors.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="principles">
<h1><a name="principles">1. Principles</a></h1>
<p>This section describes the basic organization principles for sensor
drivers in TinyOS.</p>
<p>For background, a sensor can be attached to the microcontroller on a
TinyOS platform through a few different types of connections:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Included within the microcontroller itself</li>
<li>Connected to general-purpose IO pins for level/edge detection</li>
<li>Connected to an ADC in the microcontroller for voltage sampling</li>
<li>Connected to general-purpose IO pins for digital communication</li>
<li>Connected through a standard digital bus protocol (1-Wire, I2C, SPI)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Physically, these connections can also be decoupled by attaching the
sensors to a <cite>sensor board</cite>, which can be removed from the TinyOS
platform, and could attach to multiple different TinyOS platforms.</p>
<p>The capabilities of a physical sensor are made available to a TinyOS
application through a <cite>sensor driver</cite>.</p>
<p>According to the HAA <a class="citation-reference" href="#tep2" id="id1" name="id1">[TEP2]</a>, TinyOS devices SHOULD provide both
simple hardware-independent interfaces for common-case use (HIL) and
rich hardware-dependent interfaces for special-case use (HAL). Sensor
drivers SHOULD follow this spirit as well.</p>
<p>TinyOS 2.x represents each sensor as an individual component. This
allows the compilation process to minimize the amount of code
included. A sensor board containing multiple sensors SHOULD be
represented as a collection of components, one for each sensor,
contained within a sensor board directory.</p>
<p>Sensors, being physical devices that can be shared, can benefit from
virtualization and arbitration. This document describes a design
pattern for sensor virtualization that SHOULD be followed by sensor
drivers.</p>
<p>The same physical sensor can be attached to multiple different TinyOS
platforms, through platform-dependent interconnections. The common
logic of sensor driver SHOULD be factored into chip-dependent,
platform-independent components, and those components SHOULD be bound
to the hardware resources on a platform by platform-dependent
components, and to the hardware resources on a sensor board by
sensorboard-dependent components.</p>
<p>A physical sensor has a general class and a specific set of
performance characteristics, captured by the make and model of the
sensor itself. The naming of the sensor driver components SHOULD
reflect the specifc name of the sensor, and MAY provide a component
with a generic name for application authors who only care about the
general class of the sensor.</p>
<p>This document takes no position on the meaning of the values returned
by sensor drivers. They MAY be raw uninterpreted values or they MAY
have some physical meaning. If a driver returns uninterpreted values,
the driver MAY provide additional interfaces that would allow
higher-level clients to obtain information needed to properly
interpret the value.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="sensor-hil-components">
<h1><a name="sensor-hil-components">2. Sensor HIL Components</a></h1>
<p>A sensor HIL component MUST provide:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>One or more SID interfaces <a class="citation-reference" href="#tep114" id="id2" name="id2">[TEP114]</a>, for reading data.</li>
</ul>
<p>A sensor HIL component MAY provide:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>One or more SID interfaces <a class="citation-reference" href="#tep114" id="id3" name="id3">[TEP114]</a>, for reading or
writing calibration coefficients or control registers.</li>
</ul>
<p>A sensor device driver SHOULD be a generic component that virtualizes
access to the sensor. A sensor device driver can provide such
virtualization for itself by defining a nesC generic client
component. When a client component is being used, a call to a
top-level SID interface SHOULD be delayed when the device is busy,
rather than failing. Using one of the system arbiters can make the
implementation of this requirement easier to accomplish.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
generic configuration SensirionSht11C() {
  provides interface Read&lt;uint16_t&gt; as Temperature;
  provides interface ReadStream&lt;uint16_t&gt; as TemperatureStream;
  provides interface DeviceMetadata as TemperatureDeviceMetadata;

  provides interface Read&lt;uint16_t&gt; as Humidity;
  provides interface ReadStream&lt;uint16_t&gt; as HumidityStream;
  provides interface DeviceMetadata as HumidityDeviceMetadata;
}
implementation {
  // connect to the ADC HIL, GPIO HAL, or sensor's HAL
}
</pre>
<p>When a HIL component is being used, the sensor MUST initialize itself,
either by including the <cite>MainC</cite> component and wiring to the
<cite>SoftwareInit</cite> interface, or by allowing a lower-level component (like
an ADC) to initialize itself.</p>
<p>In addition, the HIL sensor driver MUST start the physical sensor
automatically. For sensors without a constant power draw, the sensor
MAY be started once at boot time by wiring to the <cite>MainC.Boot</cite>
interface. Sensors that draw appreciable power MUST be started in
response to a call to one of the top-level SID interfaces, and stopped
some time after that call completes. Using one of the power-management
components described in <a class="citation-reference" href="#tep115" id="id4" name="id4">[TEP115]</a> can make this implementation easier.</p>
<p>Generally, simple types are made up of octets. However, sensor values
often have levels of precision besides a multiple of 8. To account for
such cases, each device MUST specify the precision of each one of its
interfaces by providing the DeviceMetadata interface:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
interface DeviceMetadata {
  command uint8_t getSignificantBits();
}
</pre>
<p>The name of the instance of DeviceMetadata MUST clearly indicate which
interface it corresponds to.</p>
<p>The getSignificantBits() call MUST return the number of significant
bits in the reading. For example, a sensor reading taken from a 12-bit
ADC MUST return the value &quot;12&quot;.</p>
<p>Sensor driver components SHOULD be named according to the make and
model of the sensing device being presented. Using specific names
gives the developer the option to bind to a particular sensor, which
provides compile-time detection of missing sensors. However, wrapper
components using &quot;common&quot; names MAY also be provided by the driver
author, to support application developers who are only concerned with
the particular type of the sensor and not its make, model, or detailed
performance characteristics.</p>
<p>A &quot;common&quot; naming layer atop a HIL might look like this:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
generic configuration TemperatureC() {
  provides interface Read&lt;uint16_t&gt;;
  provides interface ReadStream&lt;uint16_t&gt;;
  provides interface DeviceMetadata;
}
implementation {
  components new SensirionSht11C();
  Read = SensirionSht11C.Temperature;
  ReadStream = SensirionSht11C.TemperatureStream;
  DeviceMetadata = SensirionSht11C.TemperatureDeviceMetadata;
}

generic configuration HumidityC() {
  provides interface Read&lt;uint16_t&gt;;
  provides interface ReadStream&lt;uint16_t&gt;;
  provides interface DeviceMetadata;
}
implementation {
  components new SensirionSht11C();
  Read = SensirionSht11C.Humidity;
  ReadStream = SensirionSht11C.HumidityStream;
  DeviceMetadata = SensirionSht11C.HumidityDeviceMetadata;
}
</pre>
</div>
<div class="section" id="sensor-hal-components">
<h1><a name="sensor-hal-components">3. Sensor HAL Components</a></h1>
<p>Sensors with a richer interface than would be supported by the SID
interfaces MAY provide a HAL component in addition to a HIL
component.</p>
<p>A sensor HAL component MUST provide:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A SID-based interface or a specific hardware-dependent interface
with commands for sampling and controlling the sensor device.</li>
</ul>
<p>A sensor HAL component MAY need to provide:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A <cite>StdControl</cite> or <cite>SplitControl</cite> interface for manual power
management by the user, following the conventions described in
<a class="citation-reference" href="#tep115" id="id5" name="id5">[TEP115]</a>.</li>
<li>A Resource[] interface for requesting access to the device and
possibly performing automated power management.</li>
<li>Any other interfaces needed to control the device.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
configuration SensirionSht11DeviceC {
  provides interface Resource[ uint8_t client ];
  provides interface SensirionSht11[ uint8_t client ];
}
implementation {
  // connect to the sensor's platform-dependent HPL here
}
</pre>
</div>
<div class="section" id="directory-organization-guidelines">
<h1><a name="directory-organization-guidelines">4. Directory Organization Guidelines</a></h1>
<p>Because the same physical sensor can be attached to TinyOS platforms
in many different ways, the organization of sensor drivers SHOULD
reflect the distinction between sensor and sensor interconnect.</p>
<p>Sensor components commonly exist at three levels:
platform-independent, sensorboard-dependent, and
platform-dependent. Factoring a sensor driver into these three pieces
allows for greater code reuse when the same sensor is attached to
different sensorboards or platforms.</p>
<p>Platform-independent sensor driver components for a particular sensor,
like protocol logic, when in the core TinyOS 2.x source tree, SHOULD
be placed into &quot;tos/chips/&lt;sensor&gt;&quot;, where &lt;sensor&gt; reflects the make
and model of the sensor device being supported. When not a part of the
core source tree, this directory can be placed anywhere as long as the
nesC compiler recieves a <cite>-I</cite> directive pointing to the sensor's
directory. However, not all sensors have a sufficiently large amount
of platform-independent logic to justify a separate &quot;chips&quot;
directory. Sensor chips are more likely to be digital sensors than
analog sensors, for example.</p>
<p>A sensor board is a collection of sensor components with a fixed name,
intended for attachment to multiple platforms. Each sensor board MUST
have its own directory named &lt;sensorboard&gt;. Default TinyOS 2.x sensor
boards are placed in &quot;tos/sensorboards/&lt;sensorboard&gt;&quot;, but sensor
board directories can be placed anywhere as long as the nesC compiler
receives a <cite>-I</cite> directive pointing to the sensor board's directory.</p>
<p>Both sensors and sensor boards MUST have unique names. Case is
significant, but two sensor boards MUST differ in more than case. This
is necessary to support platforms where filename case differences are
not significant.</p>
<p>Each sensor board directory MUST contain a <cite>.sensor</cite> file.  This file
is a perl script which gets executed as part of the <cite>ncc</cite> nesC
compiler frontend. It can add or modify any compile-time options
necessary for a particular sensor board. It MAY modify the following
perl variables, and MUST NOT modify any others:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>&#64;new_args: This is the array of arguments which will be passed to
nescc. For instance, you might add an include directive to &#64;new_args
with push &#64;new_args, <cite>-Isomedir</cite>. This could be used to include
subdirectories.</li>
<li>&#64;commonboards: This can be set to a list of sensor board names which
will be added to the include path list. These sensor boards MUST be
in tinyos-2.x/tos/sensorboards.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the sensor board wishes to define any C types or constants, it
SHOULD place these in a file named &lt;sensorboard&gt;.h in the sensor
board's directory.</p>
<p>A sensor board directory MAY contain a &quot;chips&quot; directory, with
subdirectories for each of the sensors connected to the sensor board.
If a &quot;chips&quot; subdirectory is used, sensorboard-dependent driver
components needed to connect platform-independent logic to a
particular attachment for that sensor SHOULD be placed in
&quot;&lt;sensorboard&gt;/chips/&lt;sensor&gt;&quot;.</p>
<p>Components needed to connect the platform-independent sensor driver
components or sensorboard-dependent components to the hardware
resources available on a particular platform SHOULD be placed in
&quot;tos/&lt;platform&gt;/chips/&lt;sensor&gt;&quot;. In addition, components for a sensor
that only exists on a particular platform SHOULD be placed in a such a
directory.</p>
<p>Sensors that exist as part of a larger chip, like a MCU internal
voltage sensor, SHOULD be placed in a subdirectory of the chip's
directory. &quot;tos/&lt;chip&gt;/sensors/&lt;sensor&gt;&quot;.</p>
<p>The <cite>.platform</cite> and <cite>.sensor</cite> files need to include enough <cite>-I</cite>
directives to locate all of the necessary components needed to support
the sensors on a platform and/or sensorboard.</p>
<p>All of these directory organization guidelines are only intended for
code that will enter the core source tree. In general, sensor
components can be placed anywhere as long as the nesC compiler
receives enough <cite>-I</cite> directives to locate all of the necessary pieces.</p>

<h2><a name="digital-bus-connected-sensor">3. Digital Bus-Connected Sensor</a></h2>
<p>The Digital sensor is the most complex out of the set, and includes
six components:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>one to present the sensor (SensirionSht11C)</li>
<li>one to request arbitrated access and to transform the sensor HAL
into the sensor HIL (SensirionSht11P)</li>
<li>one to present the sensor HAL (HalSensirionSht11C)</li>
<li>one to perform the driver logic needed to support the HAL, which
twiddles pins according to a sensor-specific protocol
(SensirionSht11LogicP).</li>
<li>one to select the appropriate hardware resources, such as the clock,
data, and power pins, and to provide an arbiter for the sensor
(HplSensirionSht11C).</li>
<li>one to perform the power control logic needed to support the power
manager associated with the arbiter (HplSensirionSht11P).</li>
</ul>
<p>This bus-connected sensor is overly complex because it does not rely
on a shared framework of bus manipulation components. A sensor built
on top of the I2C or SPI bus would likely require fewer components.</p>
