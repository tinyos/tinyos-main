Abstract
====================================================================

This TEP documents the architecture of the CC2420 low power listening
radio stack found in TinyOS 2.x.  Radio stack layers and implementation 
details of the CC2420 stack will be discussed.  Readers will be better
informed about existing features, possible improvements, and limitations
of the CC2420 radio stack.  Furthermore, lessons learned from
the construction of the CC2420 radio stack can help guide development 
of future TinyOS radio stacks.


1. Introduction
====================================================================

The TI/Chipcon CC2420 radio is a complex device, requiring a rather
complex software radio stack implementation.  Although much of the 
functionality is available within the radio chip itself, there are 
still many factors to consider when implementing a flexible,
general radio stack.

The software radio stack that drives the CC2420 radio consists of
many layers that sit between the application and hardware.  The highest
levels of the radio stack modify data and headers in each packet, while
the lowest levels determine the actual send and receive behavior.  
By understanding the functionality at each layer of the stack, as well 
as the architecture of a layer itself, it is possible to easily extend 
or condense the CC2420 radio stack to meet project requirements.

Some details about the CC2420 are out of the scope of this document.
These details can be found in the CC2420 datasheet [1]_.


2. CC2420 Radio Stack Layers
====================================================================

2.1 Layer Architecture
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The CC2420 radio stack consists of layers of functionality stacked 
on top of each other to provide a complete mechanism that
modifies, filters, transmits, and controls inbound and outbound messages.  
Each layer is a distinct module that can provide and use three sets of 
interfaces in relation to the actual radio stack:  Send, Receive, and 
SplitControl.  If a general layer provides one of those interfaces, it 
also uses that interface from the layer below it in the stack.  This 
allows any given layer to be inserted anywhere in the stack through
independant wiring. For example:::

  provides interface Send;
  uses interface Send as SubSend;
  
  provides interface Receive;
  uses interface Receive as SubReceive;
  
  provides interface SplitControl;
  uses interface SplitControl as subControl;
  
The actual wiring of the CC2420 radio stack is done at the highest level
of the stack, inside CC2420ActiveMessageC.  This configuration defines 
three branches:  Send, Receive, and SplitControl. Note that not all
layers need to provide and use all three Send, Receive, and SplitControl
interfaces:::

  // SplitControl Layers
  SplitControl = LplC;
  LplC.SubControl -> CsmaC;
  
  // Send Layers
  AM.SubSend -> UniqueSendC;
  UniqueSendC.SubSend -> TransportC;
  TransportC.SubSend -> LplC.Send;
  LplC.SubSend -> CC2420DispatchC.Send;
  CC2420DispatchC.SubSend -> CsmaC;
  
  // Receive Layers
  AM.SubReceive -> LplC;
  LplC.SubReceive -> UniqueReceiveC;
  UniqueReceiveC.SubReceive -> CC2420DispatchC.Receive;
  CC2420DispatchC.SubReceive -> CsmaC;

If another layer were to be added, CC2420ActiveMessageC would need
to be modified to wire it into the correct location.  


2.1 Layer Descriptions
--------------------------------------------------------------------
The main layers we see in this version of the stack are:

- ActiveMessageP:  This is the highest layer in the stack, responsible 
  for filling in details in the packet header and providing information
  about the packet to the application level [2]_.  Because the CC2420 radio
  chip itself uses 802.15.4 headers in hardware [1]_, it is not possible
  for the layer to rearrange header bytes.

- UniqueSend:  This layer generates a unique data sequence 
  number (DSN) byte for the packet header.  This byte is generated once 
  per outgoing packet.  A receiver can detect duplicate packets by comparing
  the source and DSN byte of a received packet with previous packets.  
  DSN is defined in the 802.15.4 specification [3]_.

- MessageTransportP:  This layer provides the MessageTransport
  interface, and is responsible for retrying a packet transmission if no
  acknowledgement was heard from the receiver.  MessageTransport is 
  activated on a per-message basis, meaning the outgoing packet will
  not use MessageTransport unless it is configured ahead of time to do so.
  MessageTransport is most reliable when software acknowledgements are enabled, 
  as opposed to hardware auto acknowledgements.

- LowPowerListeningP [4]_:  This layer provides the asynchronous low 
  power listening functionality of the radio.  It is broken up into
  two parts:  CC2420LowPowerListeningP and CC2420DutyCycleP.  The
  DutyCycleP component is responsible for turning the radio on
  and off and performing detections.  After a detection occurs, 
  DutyCycleP is hands off responsibility to LowPowerListeningP to turn
  the radio off and continue duty cycling when convenient.  Low power listening 
  transmissions are activated on a per-message basis, and the layer 
  will retransmit the full outbound packet over and over until either a 
  response from the receiver is heard or the transmit time expires.

- UniqueReceive: This layer maintains a history of the source address
  and DSN byte of the past few packets it has received, and helps
  filter out duplicate received packets.

- DispatchC: This layer allows the TinyOS 2.x radio stack to interoperate
  with other non-TinyOS networks.  The 6LowPAN specifications include
  a network identifier byte after the standard 802.15.4 header [5]_.
  If interoperability frames are used, the dispatch layer provides
  functionality for setting the network byte on outgoing packets
  and filtering non-TinyOS incoming packets.  

- CsmaC:  This layer is responsible for defining 802.15.4 FCF
  byte information in the outbound packet, providing default
  backoff times when the radio detects a channel in use, and
  defining the power-up/power-down procedure for the radio.

- TransmitP/ReceiveP: These layers are responsible for interacting
  directly with the radio through the SPI bus, interrupts, and GPIO lines.


3. CC2420 Packet Format and Specifications
====================================================================

The CC2420 Packet structure is defined in CC2420.h.  The default
I-Frame CC2420 header takes on the following format:::

  typedef nx_struct cc2420_header_t {
    nxle_uint8_t length;
    nxle_uint16_t fcf;
    nxle_uint8_t dsn;
    nxle_uint16_t destpan;
    nxle_uint16_t dest;
    nxle_uint16_t src;
    nxle_uint8_t network;
    nxle_uint8_t type;
  } cc2420_header_t;

All fields up to 'network' are 802.15.4 specified fields, and are 
used in the CC2420 hardware itself. The 'network' field is a 6LowPAN 
interoperability specification [5]_.  The 'type' field is a 
TinyOS specific field.

The TinyOS T-Frame packet does not include the 'network' field, nor
the functionality found in the Dispatch layer to set and check
the 'network' field.

No software footer is defined for the CC2420 radio.  A 2-byte
CRC byte is auto-appended to each outbound packet by the CC2420 radio
hardware itself.

The CC2420 hardware has three RAM buffers: TXFIFO, RXFIFO, and a
security RAM buffer.  The TXFIFO and RXFIFO are both 128 bytes,
while the security RAM buffer is 112 bytes. Therefore, the maximum size 
of a packet is 128 bytes including its headers and CRC.  Increasing
the packet size will increase data throughput and RAM consumption
in the TinyOS application, but will also increase the probability
that interference will cause the packet to be destroyed and need
to be retransmitted, which wastes energy.  The TOSH_DATA_LENGTH
preprocessor variable can be altered to increase the size
of the message_t payload at compile time [2]_. 


4. CSMA/CA
====================================================================

4.1 Clear Channel Assessment
--------------------------------------------------------------------
By default, the CC2420 radio stack performs a clear channel assessment 
(CCA) before transmitting.  If the channel is not clear, the radio backs
off for some short, random period of time before attempting to transmit 
again.  The CC2420 chip itself provides a strobe command to transmit
the packet if the channel is currently clear.

To specify whether or not to transmit with clear channel assessment,
the CC2420TransmitP component provides two commands::

  async command error_t Send.sendCCA( message_t* p_msg )
  async command error_t Send.send( message_t* p_msg )

It is up to the CC2420CsmaP component to select the correct method of
transmission.  Sending a packet without CCA will transmit it as quickly
as possible, but interference from other transmitters will prevent
it from being delivered in many cases.  Transmitting without CCA will 
also effectively jam other DSSS transmitters on the same channel.

Future implementations should allow the application layer to specify
the use of CCA on a per-packet basis, similar to how the application 
layer has the option to specify the backoff period for an outgoing 
message.


4.2 Radio Backoff
--------------------------------------------------------------------
A backoff is a period of time where the radio pauses before attempting
to transmit. When the radio needs to backoff, it can choose one of three 
backoff periods:  initialBackoff, congestionBackoff, and lplBackoff.
These are implemented through the RadioBackoff interface, which signals
out a request to specify the backoff period.  Unlike the CsmaBackoff
interface, components that are interested in adjusting the backoff can
call back using commands in the RadioBackoff interface.  This allows 
multiple components to adjust the backoff period for packets they are 
specifically listening to adjust.  The lower the backoff period, the
faster the transmission, but the more likely the transmitter is to hog
the channel.  Also, backoff periods should be as random as possible
to prevent two transmitters from sampling the channel at the same 
moment.

InitialBackoff is the shortest backoff period, requested on the first
attempt to transmit a packet.

CongestionBackoff is a longer backoff period used when the channel is
found to be in use.  By using a longer backoff period in this case, 
the transmitter is less likely to unfairly tie up the channel. 

LplBackoff is the backoff period used for a packet being delivered
with low power listening.  Because low power listening requires 
the channel to be modulated as continuously as possible while avoiding
interference with other transmitters, the low power listening 
backoff period is intentionally short.


5. Acknowledgements
====================================================================

5.1 Hardware vs. Software Acknowledgements
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Originally, the CC2420 radio stack only used hardware generated
auto-acknowledgements provided by the CC2420 chip itself.  This led
to some issues, such as false acknowledgements where the radio chip
would receive a packet and acknowledge its reception and the 
microcontroller would never actually receive the packet.

The current CC2420 stack uses software acknowledgements, which 
have a higher drop percentage. When used with the UniqueSend
and UniqueReceive interfaces, dropped acknowledgements are more desirable 
than false acknowledgements.  Received packets are always acknowledged 
before being filtered as a duplicate.

Use the PacketAcknowledgements or MessageTransport interfaces
to determine if a packet was successfully acknowledged.


5.2 Data Sequence Numbers - UniqueSend and UniqueReceive
--------------------------------------------------------------------
The 802.15.4 specification identifies a Data Sequence Number (DSN)
byte in the message header to filter out duplicate packets [3]_.  

The UniqueSend interface at the top of the CC2420 radio stack is 
responsible for setting the DSN byte.  It is set exactly one time
per outgoing message.  Even if lower levels such as MessageTransport
or LowPowerListening retransmit the packet, the DSN byte stays the 
same.

The UniqueReceive interface at the bottom of the CC2420 radio stack
is responsible for filtering out duplicate messages based on 
source address and DSN.  The UniqueReceive interface is not meant
to stop sophisticated replay attacks.


6. Message Transport Implementation
====================================================================
Message transport is a layer added to the CC2420 radio stack to help unicast
packets get delivered successfully.  In previous version of TinyOS radio 
stacks, it was left up to the application layer to retry a message 
transmission if the application determined the message was not properly
received.  The Message Transport layer helps to remove the reliable delivery
responsibility and functional baggage from application layers.


6.1 Compiling in the Message Transport layer
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Because the Message Transport layer uses up extra memory footprint,
it is not compiled in by default.  Developers can simply define
the preprocessor variable MESSAGE_TRANSPORT to compile the functionality
of the Message Transport layer in with the CC2420 stack.


6.2 Implementation and Usage
--------------------------------------------------------------------
To send a message using Message Transport, the MessageTransport 
interface must be called ahead of time to specify two fields in the outbound
message's metadata:::
  
  command void setRetries(message_t *msg, uint16_t maxRetries);
  command void setRetryDelay(message_t *msg, uint16_t retryDelay);

The first command, setRetries(..), will specify the maximum number
of times the message should be sent before the radio stack stops
transmission.  The second command, setRetryDelay(..), specifies
the amount of delay in milliseconds between each retry.  The combination
of these two commands can set a packet to retry as many times as needed
for as long as necessary.

Because Message Transport relies on acknowledgements, false 
acknowledgements from the receiver will cause Message Transport to fail.


7. Asynchronous Low Power Listening Implementation
====================================================================
Because the Low Power Listening layer uses up extra memory footprint,
it is not compiled in by default.  Developers can simply define
the preprocessor variable LOW_POWER_LISTENING to compile the functionality
of the Low Power Listening layer in with the CC2420 stack.

7.1 Design Considerations
--------------------------------------------------------------------
The CC2420 radio stack low power listening implementation relies
on clear channel assessments to determine if there is a transmitter
nearby.  This allows the receiver to turn on and determine there are no
transmitters in a shorter amount of time than leaving the radio on
long enough to pick up a full packet. 

The transmitters perform a message delivery by transmitting
the full packet over and over again for twice the duration of the receiver's 
duty cycle period.  Transmitting for twice as long increases the 
probability that the message will be detected by the receiver, and 
allows the receiver to shave off a small amount of time it needs to 
keep its radio on.

Typically, the transmission of a single packet takes on the following 
form over time:

+--------------+---------------------------------------+----------+
| LPL Backoff  |          Packet Transmission          | Ack Wait |
+--------------+---------------------------------------+----------+

To decrease the amount of time required for a receive check, the channel 
must be modulated by the transmitter as continuously as possible. 
The only period where the channel is modulated is during the 
Packet Transmission phase.  The receiver must continuosly sample the CCA pin 
a moment longer than the LPL Backoff period and Ack Wait period combined
to overlap the Packet Transmission period.  By making the LPL backoff
period as short as possible, we can decrease the amount of time a receiver's
radio must be turned on when performing a receive check.

If two transmitters attempt to transmit using low power listening,
one transmitter may hog the channel if its LPL backoff period
is set too short.  Both nodes transmitting at the same time
will cause interference and prevent each other from 
successfully delivering their messages to the intended recipient.  

To allow multiple transmitters to transmit low power listening packets 
at the same time, the LPL backoff period needed to be increased 
greater than the desired minimum.  This increases the amount of time
receiver radios need to be on to perform a receive check because
the channel is no longer being modulated as continuously as possible.
In other words, the channel is allowed to be shared amongst multiple 
transmitters at the expense of power consumption.


7.2 Minimizing Power Consumption
--------------------------------------------------------------------
There are several methods the CC2420 radio stack uses to minimize
power consumption:

1. Invalid Packet Shutdown
  Typically, packets are filtered out by address at the radio hardware
  level.  When a receiver wakes up and does not receive any
  packets into the low power listening layer of the radio stack, it 
  will automatically go back to sleep after some period of time.  As a 
  secondary backup, if address decoding on the radio chip is disabled, 
  the low power listening implementation will shut down the radio if 
  three packets are receive that do not belong to the node.  This helps 
  prevent against denial of sleep attacks or the typical transmission 
  behavior found in an ad-hoc network with many nodes.

2. Early Transmission Completion
  A transmitter typically sends a packet for twice the amount of time
  as the receiver's receive check period.  This increases the probability
  that the receiver will detect the packet.  However, if the transmitter receives
  an acknowledgement before the end of its transmission period, it
  will stop transmitting to save energy.  This is an improvement
  over previous low power listening implementations, which transmitted
  for the full period of time regardless of whether the receiver has 
  already woken up and received the packet.

3. Auto Shutdown
  If the radio does not send or receive messages for some period of
  time while low power listening is enabled, the radio will automatically 
  turn off and begin duty cycling at its specified duty cycle period.

4. CCA Sampling Strategy
  The actual receive check is performed in a loop inside a function, 
  not a spinning task.  This allows the sampling to be performed
  continuously, with the goal of turning the radio off as quickly as 
  possible without interruption.


8. CC2420 Settings and Registers
====================================================================

To interact with registers on the CC2420 chip, the SPI bus must be
acquired, the chip selecct (CSn) pin must be cleared, and then the 
interaction may occur.  After the interaction completes, the
CSn pin must be set high.

All registers and strobes are defined in the CC2420.h file, and most 
are accessible through the CC2420SpiC component.  If your application
requires access to a specific register or strobe, the CC2420SpiC component
is the place to add access to it.

Configuring the CC2420 requires the developer to access the CC2420Config
interface provided by CC2420ControlC.  First call the CC2420Config commands to 
change the desired settings of the radio.  Next, call CC2420Config.sync()
to commit these changes to the radio chip.  If the radio is currently
off, the changes will be committed at the time it is turned on.

RSSI can be sampled directly by calling the ReadRssi interface provided
by CC2420ControlC.  See page 50 of the CC2420 datasheet for information
on how to convert RSSI to LQI and why it may not be such a good idea [1]_.



9. Cross-platform Portability
====================================================================
To port the CC2420 radio to another platform, the following interfaces
need to be implemented:::

  // GPIO Pins
  interface GeneralIO as CCA;
  interface GeneralIO as CSN;
  interface GeneralIO as FIFO;
  interface GeneralIO as FIFOP;
  interface GeneralIO as RSTN;
  interface GeneralIO as SFD;
  interface GeneralIO as VREN;
    
  // SPI Bus
  interface Resource;
  interface SpiByte;
  interface SpiPacket;

  // Interrupts
  interface GpioCapture as CaptureSFD;
  interface GpioInterrupt as InterruptCCA;
  interface GpioInterrupt as InterruptFIFOP;

The GpioCapture interface is tied through the Timer to provide a relative time
at which the interrupt occurred.  This is useful for timestamping received
packets for node synchronization.

If the CC2420 is not connected to the proper interrupt lines, 
interrupts can be emulated through the use of a spinning task
that polls the GPIO pin.  The MICAz implementation, for example, does this
for the CCA interrupt.


10. Future Improvement Recommendations
====================================================================

Many improvements can be made to the CC2420 stack.  Below are some
recommendations:

10.1 AES Encryption
--------------------------------------------------------------------
The CC2420 chip itself provides AES-128 encryption. The implementation
involves loading the security RAM buffers on the CC2420 with the information
to be encrypted - this would be the payload of a packet, without
the header.  After the payload is encrypted, the microcontroller reads
out of the security RAM buffer and concatenates the data with the 
unencrypted packet header.  This full packet would be uploaded again to the CC2420
TXFIFO buffer and transmitted.  

Because the CC2420 cannot begin encryption at a particular offset
and needs to be written, read, and re-written, use of the AES-128 may be 
inefficient and will certainly decrease throughput.


10.2 Authentication
--------------------------------------------------------------------
In many cases, authentication is more desirable than encryption. 
Encryption significantly increases energy and decreases packet throughput,
which does not meet some application requirements. A layer could be 
developed and added toward the bottom of the radio stack that validates
neighbors, preventing packets from invalid neighbors from reaching the
application layer.  Several proprietary authentication layers have
been developed for the CC2420 stack, but so far none are available to 
the general public.

A solid authentication layer would most likely involve the use of a 
neighbor table and 32-bit frame counts to prevent against replay attacks.
Once a neighbor is verified and established, the node needs to ensure that
future packets are still coming from the same trusted source.  Again,
some high speed low energy proprietary methods to accomplish this exist, but 
encryption is typically the standard method used.


10.3 Synchronous Low Power Listening
--------------------------------------------------------------------
A synchronous low power listening layer can be transparently built on 
top of the asynchronous low power listening layer.  One implementation
of this has already been done on a version of the CC1000 radio stack.
Moteiv's Boomerang radio stack also has a synchronous low power listening 
layer built as a standalone solution.

In the case of building a synchronous layer on top of the asynchronous
low power listening layer, a transmitter's radio stack can detect when 
a particular receiver is performing its receive checks by verifying the 
packet was acknowledged after a sendDone event.  The transmitter can then 
build a table to know when to begin transmission for that particular receiver.
Each successful transmission would need to adjust the table with updated 
information to avoid clock skew problems.

The asynchronous low power listening stack needs to be altered a bit
to make this strategy successful.  Currently, duty cycling is started
and stopped as packets are detected, received, and transmitted.  The
stack would need to be altered to keep a constant clock running in the
background that determines when to perform receive checks.  The
clock should not be affected by normal radio stack Rx/Tx behavior.  This 
would allow the receiver to maintain a predictable receive check cycle
for the transmitter to follow.

If the synchronous low power listening layer loses synchronization,
the radio stack can always fall back on the asynchronous low power listening
layer for successful message delivery.


10.4 Neighbor Tables
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Moteiv's Boomerange Sensornet Protocol (SP) implementation is a very 
good model to follow for radio stack architecture.  One of the nice features
of SP is the design and implementation of the neighbor table.  By
providing and sharing neighbor table information across the entire
CC2420 radio stack, RAM can be conserved throughout the radio stack
and TinyOS applications.


10.5 Radio Independant Layers
--------------------------------------------------------------------
The best radio stack architecture is one that is completely radio independant.
Many of the layers in the CC2420 stack can be implemented independant
of the hardware underneath if the radio stack architecture was redesigned
and reimplemented. The low power listening receive check strategy may need a 
hardware-dependant implementation, but other layers like MessageTransport,
UniqueSend, UniqueReceive, ActiveMessage, Dispatch, etc. do not require
a CC2420 underneath to operate properly.  The ultimate TinyOS radio
stack would be one that forms an abstraction between radio-dependant
layers and radio-independant layers, and operates with the same
behavior across any radio chip.


10.6 Extendable Metadata
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Layers added into the radio stack may require extra bytes of metadata.
The MessageTransport layer, for example, requires two extra fields
in each message's metadata to hold the message's max retries and
delay between retries.  The low power listening layer requires
an extra field to specify the destination's duty cycle period for
a proper delivery.

If layers are not included in the radio stack during compile time,
their fields should not be included in the message_t's metadata.

One version of extendable metadata was implementing using an array at the end
of the metadata struct that would adjust its size based on which layers were
compiled in and what size fields they required.  A combination of
compiler support in the form of unique(..) and uniqueCount(..) functions
made it possible for the array to adjust its size.  

Explicit compiler support would be the most desirable solution to add 
fields to a struct as they are needed.


10.7 Error Correcting Codes (ECC)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
When two nodes are communicating near the edge of their RF range,
it has been observed that interference may cause the packet to be
corrupted enough that the CRC byte and payload actually passes
the check, even though the payload is not valid.  There is a one
in 65535 chance of a CRC byte passing the check for a corrupted
packet.  Although this is slim, in many cases it is unacceptable.
Some work arounds have implemented an extra byte of software generated
CRC to add to the reliability, and tests have proven its effectiveness.
Taking this a step further, an ECC layer in the radio stack would help 
correct corrupted payloads and increase the distance at which nodes 
can reliably communicate.
