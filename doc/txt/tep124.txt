Abstract
============================================================================

The memo documents the Link Estimation Exchange Protocol (LEEP). Nodes
use LEEP to estimate and exchange information about the quality of
links to the neighbors.

1. Introduction
============================================================================

Routing protocols often require bi-directional link qualities to
compute the routes. Nodes can estimate the quality of the in-bound
link from a neighbor by estimating the ratio of successfully received
messages and the total transmitted messages. LEEP appends in-bound
packet reception rate (PRR) estimates to packets. Other nodes hearing
these packets can combine the in-bound PRR values with their own
in-bound values to compute bi-directional link quality. Thus, LEEP is
a discovery and link table bootstrapping mechanism. The link quality
is often fine-tuned using different mechanisms.

Link quality estimates obtained using LEEP are often used as
bootstrapping values in the link quality table; data transmission
statistics can later be used to make these estimates more accurate.

2. Definitions
============================================================================

2.1 In-bound Link Quality
--------------------------------------------------------------------

In a node pair (A,B), with B as the node of reference, in-bound link
quality is a value in the range of 0 to 255 that describes the quality
of the link from A to B estimated by B as the fraction of successfully
received packets from A. Thus, in-bound link quality is the empirical
probability that a packet will be successfully received on a given
link. A value of 255 represents a probability of 1 and a value of 0
represents a probability of 0 of successfully receiving a packet on a
given link.

2.2 Out-bound Link Quality
--------------------------------------------------------------------

In a node pair (A,B), with B as the node of reference, out-bound link
quality is defined as the quality of the link from B to A. B can
determine the out-bound link quality if A advertises its in-bound link
qualities. LEEP is the protocol that is used to exchange the in-bound
link qualities.

2.3 Bi-directional Link Quality
--------------------------------------------------------------------

LEEP does not define or compute bi-directional link quality. LEEP
provides a way to exchange sufficient information to compute in-bound
and out-bound link qualities. These two link qualities can be used to
compute the bi-directional link quality. Routing protocols often
compute the bi-directional link quality of a node pair (A,B) as a
function (product, min, etc.) of the link quality of (A,B) and (B,A).


2.4 Link Information Entry
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Link Information Entry created by node k is a tuple (n,q) where q is
the in-bound link quality from node n to k.

3. The Link Estimation Exchange Protocol (LEEP)
============================================================================

3.1 Assumptions
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Following are the assumptions made by LEEP:

3.1.1. The data link frame has a single-hop source field.
3.1.2. The data link layer provides a broadcast address.
3.1.3. The data link layer provides the length of the LEEP frame.

3.2 The Protocol
--------------------------------------------------------------------

To compute the bi-directional link quality, in-bound link quality must
be exchanged among the neighbors. LEEP maintains a sequence number
that is incremented by one for each outgoing LEEP frame. The sequence
number in the LEEP frame MUST be incremented by one even if the data
link layer retransmits the LEEP frame. The LEEP sequence number MAY be
used to count the number of missing packets to estimate the in-bound
link quality from the transmitter. LEEP MUST transmit Link Information
entries describing the in-bound link qualities for a subset of its
neighbors. The Link Information entry on the LEEP frame allows the
receiver node to find the out-bound link quality to the transmitter
node identified by the data link source address. Thus, LEEP is also a
way for nodes to discover new nodes and links in the network.

Link quality estimation is inherently imperfect - data transmission
and link quality estimation might be done at different timescales. The
PRR for LEEP frames (broadcast) and data frames (unicast) might be
different. So LEEP is better used as a link quality bootstrapping
mechanism. The link quality estimate can be made more accurate later
using data transmission statistics.



3.3 LEEP Frame
--------------------------------------------------------------------

A LEEP frame has a header, the payload, and a footer with the Link
Information (LI) entries as shown in this diagram::

  -------------------------------------------------------------
  |   LEEP   | Payload | LI Entry | LI Entry | ... | LI Entry |
  |  Header  |         |     1    |     2    |     |     n    |
  -------------------------------------------------------------

The number of Link Information entries can be different in each
outgoing LEEP frame. The number of Link Information entries MUST not
increase the size of the LEEP frame beyond the maximum payload length
allowed by the data link layer. A LEEP frame can have 0 Link
Information entry.

3.3.1 LEEP header
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The following diagram shows the LEEP header format::

                           1
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |nentry | rsrvd |     seqno     |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


Field definitions:

  * nentry - Number of Link Information entries in the footer
  * seqno - LEEP sequence number.
  * rsrvd - Reserved and must be set to 0.


3.3.2 Link Information Entry
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The following diagram shows the Link Information Entry format::

                           1
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |            node id            |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      | link quality  |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

Field definitions:

  * node id: the link layer address of the neighbor
  * link quality: The in-bound link quality from the node identified by node id
    to the node that transmits this Link Information entry


4. Implementation
============================================================================

The following files in ``tinyos-2.x/tos/lib/net/le`` provide a
reference implementation of LEEP described in this TEP.

  * ``LinkEstimator.h`` and ``LinkEstimatorP.nc``

The reference implementation uses the LEEP sequence number to count
the number of missing packets to estimate the in-bound link
quality. The implementation tries to append Link Information entry for
all the neighbors in its neighbor table by sending the largest
possible data link frame. If there is still not enough room to fit all
the Link Information entries, it uses a round-robin policy to select
the entries to be exchanged that could not fit in the previous LEEP
frame. The LEEP frames are transmitted whenever the CTP [1]_ beacons,
sent as a LEEP payload, are sent.

Another reference implementation resides in
``tinyos-2.x/tos/lib/net/4bitle``. This implementation is described in
detail in [2]_.
