.. Note::

   This memo documents a part of TinyOS for the TinyOS Community, and
   requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.  Distribution
   of this memo is unlimited. This memo is in full compliance with
   [TEP_1]_ and [TEP_4]_.


1. Introduction
====================================================================

TinyOS network protocols use allocated Active Message Type [TEP_116]_
to prevent AM ID conflict between different protocols. [TEP_4]_
describes how AM IDs are allocated for a TinyOS network protocol. In
this TEP, we document the AM ID allocations in TinyOS 2.1.

2. Unreserved pool 128-255 (0x80 - 0xFF)
====================================================================

The unreserved pool is in the range 128-255 (0x80-0xFF). Applications
distributed with TinyOS use AM IDs in this range. Protocols and
applications in contrib as well as those developed by the community
but not included in the distribution or contrib SHOULD use AM IDs in
this range.

3. Reserved pool 0-127 (0x00 - 0x7F)
====================================================================

The reserved pool is in the range 0-127 (0x00-0x7F). The AM IDs in
this range are used by protocols distributed with TinyOS.

Here is a list of allocations for TinyOS 2.1::

  * 0x70 - 0x75 are reserved for collection protocols [TEP_119]_
    maintained by the Network Protocol Working Group.

    For CTP (''tos/lib/net/ctp'') [TEP_123]_ and LEEP  [TEP_124]_
    0x70 - AM_CTP_ROUTING CTP (Routing beacon)
    0x71 - AM_CTP_DATA CTP (Data packets)
    0x72 - AM_CTP_DEBUG CTP (Debug messages)

    For MultiHopLQI (''tos/lib/net/lqi'')
    0x73 - AM_LQI_BEACON_MSG (Routing beacon)
    0x74 - AM_LQI_DATA_MSG MultiHopLQI (Data packets)
    0x75 - AM_LQI_DEBUG MultiHopLQI (Debug messages)

  * 0x60 - 0x62 are reserved for dissemination protocols [TEP_118]_
    maintained by the Network Protocol Working Group.

    For Drip (''tos/lib/net/drip'')
    0x60 - AM_DISSEMINATION_MESSAGE
    0x61 - AM_DISSEMINATION_PROBE_MESSAGE

    For DIP (''tos/lib/net/dip'')
    0x62 - AM_DIP 

  * 0x50 - 0x54 are reserved for Deluge (''tos/lib/net/Deluge'')
    maintained by the Network Protocol Working Group.

    0x50 - AM_DELUGEADVMSG (Advertisements)
    0x51 - AM_DELUGEREQMSG (Requests)
    0x52 - AM_DELUGEDATAMSG (Data)
    0x53 - DELUGE_AM_FLASH_VOL_MANAGER (Flash volume manager)
    0x54 - DELUGE_AM_DELUGE_MANAGER (Deluge manger)

  * 0x3F - TinyOS NALP code [TEP_125]_ reserved by the Core Working
    Group.
