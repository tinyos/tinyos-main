/**
 * Wire together the IP stack
 *
 * To make it somewhat flexible, the stack consists of four main
 * layers: Protocol, Routing, NeighborDiscovery, and Dispatch.  This
 * component wires them together.
 *
 * Protocol: dispatch based on the final next header value in an
 * ipv6_packet.
 *
 * Routing: determine the next-hop for a packet as a link-local
 * address.  This is accomplished by looking up the destination
 * address in the forwarding table.
 *
 * NeighborDiscovery: responsible for address resolution.  Very
 * simple, since only link-local addresses are considered to be
 * on-link.
 *
 * Dispatch: okay, this one's badly named.  It's the 6lowpan engine
 * which talks to a packet radio on the bottom and presents fully
 * reassembled and decompressed IPv6 packets on top.  This means most
 * of the stack can ignore the fact that there's all this magic going
 * on.
