/**
 * DHCP v6 Client implementation for TinyOS
 *
 * Implements a simple subset of RFC3315 DHCP for stateful address
 * configuration.  This protocol engine solicits on-link DHCP servers
 * or relay agents, and then attempts to obtain permanent (IA_NA)
 * addresses from them.  After an address is acquired, it will renew
 * it using the parameters contained in the Identity Association
 * binding; if the lease expires, it will revoke the address using the
 * IPAddress interface.  At that point all components should stop
 * using that address as it is no longer valid.
