/**
 * InternalFlash.h - Internal flash implementation for telos msp
 * platform. On the msp, the flash must first be erased before a value
 * can be written. However, the msp can only erase the flash at a
 * segment granularity (128 bytes for the information section). This
 * module allows transparent read/write of individual bytes to the
 * information section by dynamically switching between the two
 * provided segments in the information section.
 *
 * Valid address range is 0x1000 - 0x107E (0x107F is used to store the
 * version number of the information segment).
