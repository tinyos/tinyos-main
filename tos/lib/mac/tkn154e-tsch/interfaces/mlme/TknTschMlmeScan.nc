   * Initializes a channel scan over a given list of channels.

   * If the PIB attribute <tt>macAutoRequest</tt> is set to FALSE, then
   * for each received beacon a PAN descriptor is signalled to the next higher
   * layer through a separate <tt>MLME_BEACON_NOTIFY.indication()</tt> 
   * event; otherwise the result of the channel scan is stored in a user
   * allocated buffer, either <tt>EnergyDetectList</tt> or 
   * <tt>PANDescriptorList</tt> depending on <tt>ScanType</tt>, and the 
   * buffer is returned when the scan is completed.

   * Both of the parameters <tt>EnergyDetectList</tt> and 
   * <tt>PANDescriptorList</tt> may be NULL, but at least one of them 
   * must be NULL.
   *
   * @param ScanType The type of scan performed: ENERGY_DETECTION_SCAN,
   *                 ACTIVE_SCAN, PASSIVE_SCAN or ORPHAN_SCAN
   * @param ScanChannels The 27 LSBs indicate which channels are to be
   *                     scanned (1 = scan, 0 = don't scan)
   * @param ScanDuration Value used to calculate the length of time to
   *                     spend scanning each channel for ED, active, and
   *                     passive scans.  This parameter is ignored for
   *                     orphan scans.
   * @param ChannelPage The channel page on which to perform the scan
   * @param PANDescriptorListNumEntries The number of entries in the
   *                    <tt>PANDescriptorList</tt>.
   * @param PANDescriptorList An empty buffer (allocated by the caller)   
   *                     to store the result of the active/passive scan 
   *                     or NULL if the result should not be stored
   * @param security    The security options (NULL means security is 
   *                    disabled)
   * @return       IEEE154_SUCCESS if the request succeeded and a confirm event
   *               will be signalled, an appropriate error code otherwise 
   *               (no confirm event will be signalled in this case)
