   * The MLME-BEACON.request primitive requests the generation of a beacon or 
   * enhanced beacon in a non- beacon-enabled PAN, either in response to a beacon 
   * request command when macBeaconAutoRespond is FALSE, or on demand, e.g., 
   * to send beacons to enable a TSCH passive scan.
   * 
   * @param BeaconType  BEACON = 0: send a beacon. ENHANCED BEACON = 1: 
                        send an enhanced beacon.
   * @param SrcAddrMode The source addressing mode for device from whom the 
                        beacon request was received. 
   * @param SrcAddr     The device who sent the beacon request, if present, 
                        otherwise the short broadcast address (0xffff)
   * @param dstPANID    The PANID contained in the beacon request, or the broadcast 
                        PAN ID (0xffff) if PAN ID not present.
   * @param IEList      If BeaconType = 0x01, the EB Filter IE and/or other IEs are 
                        contained in the beacon request. Otherwise it is empty.
   *
   * @return       IEEE154_SUCCESS if the request succeeded and a confirm event
   *               will be signalled, an appropriate error code otherwise 
   *               (no confirm event will be signalled in this case)
