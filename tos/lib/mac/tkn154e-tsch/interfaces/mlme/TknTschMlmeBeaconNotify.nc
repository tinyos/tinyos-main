   * The MLME-BEACON-NOTIFY.indication primitive is used to send parameters contained
   * within a beacon frame or an enhanced beacon frame received by the MAC sublayer to
   * the next higher layer when either macAutoRequest is set to FALSE or when the beacon
   * frame contains one or more octets of payload. The primitive also sends a measure of
   * the LQI and the time the beacon frame was received. When an enhanced beacon is
   * received, the SDU contains a list of IEs, and Superframe Specification, GTS fields,
   * PendingAdd, and beacon Payload parameters are not present.
   *
   * @param SDU    The set of octets comprising the beacon payload including
   *               Payload IEs if present.
   *
   * @return       Return a message_t that must not be used by the upper layer anymore.

   *  The fields defined in IEEE 802.15.4 "BSN", "PANDescriptor", "PendAddrSpec" and
   *  "AddrList" are neglected here, since not relevant for TSCH.
