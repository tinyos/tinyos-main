/**
 * Implementation of the generic TKN finite state machine
 *
 * This component keeps a single state variable. The state can be arbitrarily
 * changed at any time. Actions are executed once an event is received.
 * An external lookup table is used to decide which event handler to call
 * depending on the current state and event. Event handlers are identified by
 * IDs and the mapping between IDs and handling functions happens externally by
 * wiring to the matching TknFsmStateHandler instance.
