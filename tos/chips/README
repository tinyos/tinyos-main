1. Introduction
====================================================================

Platform dependant code independent of a specific platform
----------------------------------------------------------

The tos/chips directory is designed to house code to drive a 
particular chip in a way that can be shared across disparate 
platforms that share that particular chip.  

One of the main issues in tinyos-1.x that limited portability 
was that similar platforms would often copy code files hard-code 
customizations, rather than rigorously share common code.  By
placing chip-specific code here in a designated chips directory,
and enforcing a policy of making this code specific to the chip
but not the platform, code reuse will be promoted.

2. Microcontrollers
====================================================================

ATmega128	
---------
    Part of the AVR 8-bit series by Atmel corporation.  Atmel's AVR® microcontrollers have a RISC core running single cycle instructions and a well-defined I/O structure that limits the need for external components. Internal oscillators, timers, UART, SPI, pull-up resistors, pulse width modulation, ADC, analog comparator and watch-dog timers are some of the features you will find in AVR devices.

    	128-Kbyte self-programming Flash Program Memory, 
	4-Kbyte SRAM, 4-Kbyte EEPROM, 8 Channel 10-bit A/D-converter. 
	JTAG interface for on-chip-debug. Up to 16 MIPS throughput at 16 MHz. 
	2.7 - 5.5 Volt operation.

msp430
------
    The MSP430 family of ultra-low-power 16-bit RISC mixed-signal processors from Texas Instruments provides the ultimate solution for battery-powered measurement applications.

3. Radio Chips
====================================================================

cc2420
------
    The CC2420 is a low-cost transceiver designed specifically
for low-power, low-voltage RF applications in the 2.4 GHz unlicensed ISM band. It is the first commercially available RF Transceiver compliant with the IEEE 802.15.4 standard and the first RF-IC that can be qualified for use in 2.4 GHz ZigBeetm products.

cc1000
------
    The CC1000 is a true ultra-low-power single-chip RF transceiver for e.g. the 315, 433, 868, 915 MHz bands. It has been specifically designed to comply with the most stringent demands of the low power radio market.  Based on a pure CMOS technology this is the first product in the market that offers a unique combination of low cost and high integration, performance and flexibility, thus setting a new standard for short-range wireless communication.
