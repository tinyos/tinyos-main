# Includes that should take precedence come first.  Platforms come before
# chips because they may override files.  These must be specified as
# @includes instead of -I's to @opts, otherwise the %T won't be processed
# by ncc.  And because of that, the current platform's include directory
# must be specified, otherwise its search order is last instead of first.
