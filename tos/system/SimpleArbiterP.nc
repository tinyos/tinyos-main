/**
 * Please refer to TEP 108 for more information about this component and its
 * intended use.<br><br>
 *
 * This component provides the Resource, ArbiterInfo, and ResourceRequested
 * interfaces and uses the ResourceConfigure interface as
 * described in TEP 108.  It provides arbitration to a shared resource.
 * An queue is used to keep track of which users have put
 * in requests for the resource.  Upon the release of the resource by one
 * of these users, the queue is checked and the next user
 * that has a pending request will ge granted control of the resource.  If
 * there are no pending requests, then the resource becomes idle and any
 * user can put in a request and immediately receive access to the
 * Resource.
